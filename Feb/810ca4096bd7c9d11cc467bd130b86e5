And yet as Jeffrey Sachs, a professor from Columbia University, noted, the destruction may have been carried out by one or more NATO members. Some people also commented that the so-called national investigations conducted by NATO countries are no different from asking a person to probe into himself, which would naturally lack credibility for the world, said Wang.China supports the UN, as the most authoritative and representative international organization, to play an active and constructive role in conducting international investigations and ensuring the security of transnational infrastructure. China supports the Security Council's discussion on this issue, Wang said.China also hope that the US will give a convincing explanation as soon as possible for the recent reports saying that the US was behind the Nord Stream explosions, and respond to the questions and concerns of the international community, Wang noted.Global Times
