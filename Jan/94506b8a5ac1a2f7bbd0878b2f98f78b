It has a designed lifespan of 15 years and will be positioned at 134Â°E co-located with two other communication satellites.Focusing on the customized payload market in Southeast Asia, the APSTAR-6E satellite will provide cost-effective high throughput communication services.The APSTAR-6E satellite is the new generation of all-electric propulsion commercial satellites, and also the first Chinese satellite to achieve autonomous orbit transfer. The successful launch of the APSTAR-6E satellite marks a step into a new era of high-capacity and low-cost satellite platforms, and improves competitiveness in the international market, according to a statement CGWIC sent to the Global Times.Also on Friday, at 3 pm, the Long March-2D sent the Yaogan-37 remote sensing satellite along with two other small test satellites into orbit from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China's Gobi Desert.Dubbed the "golden rocket" in the Long March family, the Long March-2D launch vehicle is expected to perform 13 launches out of some 50-plus mission launches scheduled for 2023.
