He said that the Pakistan-China friendship spans over more than seven decades and is imbued with a high level of trust and commonality of interests, and has matured into a comprehensive strategic partnership at the national level.In this regard, it is heartening to see the PLA Navy grow into a blue-water navy with a variety of modern platforms in their inventory, including the three aircraft carriers, Admiral Niazi said."The latest PLA Navy aircraft carrier the Fujian, designed by Chinese engineers and equipped with electromagnetic aircraft launch system, is a significant leap in the field of naval technology," said the Pakistani naval chief."Aircraft carriers reflect a country's strategic orientation and power projection capability. In this regard, keeping in view the strategic relations of Pakistan and China as iron-clad brothers, we wish for the PLA Navy to grow from strength to strength and continue with its modernization efforts to safeguard its national interests, as per evolving geo-strategic dictates," Admiral Niazi said.In addition to equipment development, Admiral Niazi also spoke highly of the PLA Navy's personnel development: "Over the last decade, the PLA Navy has grown exponentially and transformed into a highly competent and combat-ready force. Based on my recent interactions, I have found PLA Navy personnel highly professional, determined, and well-trained in line with the modern trends. The conduct of PLA Navy ships at sea highlights their professionalism and adherence to well-defined procedures which indicates the high standards of PLA Navy training institutes."It is encouraging to observe similar traits in Pakistan Navy personnel that have been availed of various training courses in China, Admiral Niazi said."I have no doubt that the PLA Navy is on its way to becoming one of the finest and leading navies, in days to come," the Pakistani naval chief said.
