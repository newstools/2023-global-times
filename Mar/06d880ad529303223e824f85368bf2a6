It has proven to be the best institutional arrangement for ensuring sustained prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao after their return to the motherland. The policy must be adhered to over the long term.In the government work report delivered at the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on Sunday morning, Premier Li Keqiang also noted that the effective exercises of the full jurisdiction over the HKSAR in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, the implementation of national security and the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong," put forward the city from chaos to governance and prosperity.A street poll in Hong Kong showed that 71.9 percent of the respondents believe that the rule of law has been restored after the implementation of the National Security Law, 86 percent agreed that Hong Kong has the constitutional responsibility to safeguard national security, and 75.7 percent were satisfied with the effectiveness of the implementation of the law, Ho mentioned in the proposal.However, she also pointed out that the popularization of the National Security Law education cannot be achieved overnight, but should be adhered to for a long time, so as to solve the long-standing deep contradictions in Hong Kong society.The younger generations in Hong Kong are active in thinking, full of passion and personality which makes them the key groups easily influenced by anti-China, destabilizing forces, said Ho, noting that it is necessary to pay special attention to the guidance and correction of their thoughts, and to rekindle their national awareness of patriotism and sense of belonging to Hong Kong and their country.Primary and secondary school students in Hong Kong should be encouraged and organized to go to the mainland for patriotic trips, including exploring the picturesque landscape of the motherland, and understanding the history and local customs of the local society.At the same time, authorities should create opportunities for Hong Kong graduates to work in enterprises and institutions in the mainland. This will not only enable them to understand the local society and get in touch with the people there, but also solve the employment and development problems of Hong Kong youths to a certain extent.Global Times
