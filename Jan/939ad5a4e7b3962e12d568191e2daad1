The policy shift includes lifting international flight capacity, which means that Chinese and foreign airlines, including those from the US, may operate scheduled passenger flights in accordance with bilateral air transport agreements.Liang said that a recovery will take a relatively long time, since the resumption of international flights is affected by multiple factors such as demand, capacity, schedule coordination and approval by domestic and foreign civil aviation authorities.She said that after three years of the epidemic, it will take time for people to recover their willingness to travel across borders. Overall, the international aviation market recovery will be slower than for the domestic sector.The number of international flights to and from China stood at 563 this week, equivalent to about 6 percent of the pre-epidemic level in 2019, Liang said. Based on this, a preliminary forecast is that the number of international flights will increase before the end of February, and return to about 1,000 flights per week, or about 11 percent of the 2019 level.By the end of March, the aviation market will further recover to 15-25 percent of the pre-epidemic level, reaching 1,300-2,300 flights per week. The recovery of the international aviation market is expected to accelerate in the second half of this year. "If the market recovers well, the number of flights by the end of the year is expected to return to 80 percent of the pre-epidemic level, reaching 7,300 flights per week," said Liang.
