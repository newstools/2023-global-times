From January to October 2022, the e-commerce imports and export s in Hunchun city reached 2 billion, recording a year-on-year increase of about 77.5 percent, people.com.cn reported.  "The pandemic impacted cross-border movement of people, but on the other hand, it accelerated the circulation of goods through cross-border e-commerce platforms," Sun Jufeng, an official from the international cooperation pilot zone, said.With effective pandemic prevention and control measures in place in 2022, the ports in Hunchun maintained stable operation last year. Goods continued to flow to Hunchun from nearby ports that were halted due to the COVID resurgences, Sun said.Hunchun, administered by the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, has four ports, two serving Russia and two serving North Korea. With Hunchun acting as a distribution center, international logistics operators can realize sea-railway-land combined transport. Goods from Russia, Japan, South Korea and South America can arrive at the nearby ports and be transported into China, and vice versa, the Global Times learned from local officials.Thanks to its unique location, Hunchun seized the opportunity to expand its local e-commerce sector starting from 2017, a trend that was accelerated despite the pandemic in the past three years.

It also represents a new path to promote consumption upgrade. Being decentralized, globalization can meet consumers' needs for tailor-made products, analysts noted.Data from Chinese customs showed that the country's import and export scale of the cross-border e-commerce increased nearly 10-fold in the past five years, and its share in foreign trade rose from less than 1 percent in 2015 to 4.9 percent in 2021.In November 2022, China approved the establishment of comprehensive pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce in 33 cities and regions across the country, in a bid to leverage the positive role of cross-border e-commerce in facilitating transformation, upgrading and digital development of traditional industries and to optimize China's foreign trade.The country set up its first comprehensive pilot zone for cross-border e-commerce in 2015, and has since expanded the number of industrial zones several times. The number of comprehensive pilot zones for cross-border e-commerce has reached more than 100 now across the country.
