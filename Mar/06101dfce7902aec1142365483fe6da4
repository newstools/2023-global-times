The company recently decided to cut its dividend payout to the lowest in 16 years and planned to scale back big investments to save cash, according to Reuters.Meanwhile, many leading US tech firms have been laying off staff. It is the US companies and "of course, the US allies' companies, which the US never cared about" that will ultimately pay the price, Xiang said.The US has been forcing or cajoling its allies to join its curbs against China, and has reportedly reached agreements with the Netherlands and Japan. Though the CEO of the Dutch chip-gear giant ASML Holding has complained about losses under the US restrictions, the Dutch government followed Washington's steps and announced plans on Wednesday to impose additional export restrictions on the "most advanced" semiconductor technology to China.By interfering in normal economic and trading activities, such moves seriously hinder the operation of the global supply chain and technological advancement, analysts stressed.
