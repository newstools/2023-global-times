It’s also less likely that another large-scale epidemic like this one will emerge in the future, with the optimization of prevention and control strategies, Wu noted.Since China started managing COVID-19 with measures designed for combating Class B  instead of Class A infectious diseases on January 8, the optimized measures against the epidemic remain effective for timely detection and effective control of the epidemic, said Wu.In the past three years, in response to the constantly changing situation of the epidemic, China has issued 10 editions of COVID-19 control protocols, and avoided the large-scale spreading of the original strain and Delta strain with strong pathogenicity, reducing deaths and severe illness from COVID-19, according to Wu.Compared with three years ago, the pathogenicity of the Omicron strain has significantly weakened. We have more knowledge of the virus and have more types of antiviral drugs as well as more experience in treating COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine  and Western medicine, Wu noted.
