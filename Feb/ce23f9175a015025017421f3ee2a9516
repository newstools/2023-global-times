A view of Lujiazui, Shanghai Photo:VCGChinese modernization not only boosts China's development, but also contributes to global prosperity, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Friday, responding to the world's interest in Chinese modernization.Recently, William Jones, the Washington bureau chief for the Executive Intelligence Review, said that it is much better for developing countries to learn from the Chinese path to modernization than to copy the old path of Western modernization. Some Western scholars also describe the Chinese path to modernization as "Version 3.0."At a regular press conference on Friday, Wang said that Chinese modernization offers a new vision that is different from Western modernization and creates a new form of human advancement.Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially since the reform and opening-up period, China has completed in several decades a journey that took Western developed countries several centuries, Wang said, noting that the nation has also created a miracle of achieving rapid economic development and long-term social stability, and vigorously promoted the process of world modernization.Chinese modernization contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the fine traditional Chinese culture and the Chinese context, according to the spokesperson.It is a modernization involving a huge population, and a modernization with common prosperity for all people, Wang noted.So far, no more than 30 countries in the world have achieved industrialization. Wang said the fact that China has modernized with such a huge population will completely rewrite the modern world map.China's path to modernization breaks the myth that "modernization equals Westernization" and provides a new alternative to realize modernization."It shows the world that each country can independently explore its own modernization path based on its own national conditions and achieve leaping development," the spokesperson said.While the Chinese path to modernization has drawn wide attention among international scholars, media and politicians, Wang said that Chinese path to modernization is the common wealth of the world."We neither export nor ask other countries to copy the Chinese mode. In the meantime, we are ready to share our development experience. We have confidence that the success of the Chinese path to modernization will contribute more insights for addressing global challenges facing humanity and provide new choices and opportunities for countries in the world to realize modernization," Wang said.Global Times
