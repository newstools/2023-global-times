Ministry of Finance in Beijing Photo: VCGChina's deficit-to-GDP ratio is set at 3 percent for 2023, according to the Government Work Report submitted by the State Council on Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation, as China puts emphasis on expanding domestic demand as one of its key agenda for propel economic growth this year.The ratio, 0.2 percentage points higher than the levels in 2022, was proposed in the Government Work Report, which Premier Li Keqiang delivered to the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) on Sunday.China will enhance the intensity and effectiveness of its proactive fiscal policy in 2023, according to the Government Work Report. To further expand domestic demand in 2023, it is also proposed that 3.8 trillion yuan ($550 billion) be allocated for special-purpose bonds for local governments. The figure compares to 3.65 trillion yuan in 2022.Fully reflecting confidence in the economic recovery for this year after a decisive victory against COVID-19, while also balancing against the impact of external uncertainties, China set its GDP growth target in 2023 at around 5 percent.Chinese economists said the proposed budget plan means moderately expanding fiscal spending in 2023, and sectors such as infrastructure projects standing to benefit from the budget. Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Sunday that as the Chinese economy continues to stage a recovery, it still needs a "certain level of stimulus" to maintain the growth momentum.With Western developed economies raising interests rates to tame inflation, China's real economy needs further impetus to avoid running into risks, Dong said, noting that the retching up the annual deficit-to-GDP ratio is deemed moderate rather than aggressive, reflecting the stable and sound development momentum of the Chinese economy.Liao Qun, chief economist with Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that as China enjoys a higher multiplier effect for fiscal spending than most developed economies and developing countries at roughly a ratio of 1 fiscal dollar spent for 2 dollars gained in the real economy.The 0.2 percentage point increase in the proposed budgeted deficit could translate into an increase of 0.4 percentage points of GDP, Liao noted.The hike in special-purpose bonds for local governments, which would be most likely used as infrastructure investment, could potentially result in a gain of 0.1 percentage point in 2023 GDP, Liao noted.Liao predicted that Infrastructure investment will likely see further growth while investment into manufacturing and real estate property will also experience some gains.The Government Work Report on Sunday calls for China to do more to implement a prudent monetary policy in a targeted way and keeping the yuan exchange rate generally stable at an adaptive and balanced level in 2023.Experts said the 3 percent deficit-to-GDP ratio showed that the central government factored in concerns for sustainable fiscal growth, while reserved some policy leeway for coping with potential risks throughout the year.In 2020, China set the budget deficit target to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product to combat the economic onslaught of the COVID-19.
