File Photo: VCGThe head of Taiwan island's executive body Su Tseng-chang announced on Thursday that his team will resign en masse, and his resignation is pending approval from the regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan-based media outlets reported.Su made the announcement after the region's legislature approved the general budget for fiscal 2023 and closed for winter recess. Following the approval of the budget, he met with Tsai and again tendered his resignation after an earlier offer to resign was turned down.Su was a "Taiwan independence" diehard who was put on a sanctions list by the Chinese mainland in August 2022, according to the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.After the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was defeated in the 2022 local "elections" in Taiwan, there were growing calls in the island for a reshuffle of the administrative affairs agency.Su's resignation has triggered a power struggle within the DPP authorities and affected the party's positioning for the regional "election" in 2024.Lo Ping-cheng, spokesperson for the regional executive body, said in a separate statement that Su and his team will formally step down once Tsai has confirmed their replacements.Global Times
