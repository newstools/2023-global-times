"The ammunition they used was advanced in fact."Historical records show that in 1886, the Qing government ordered two dome-clad cruisers from the Armstrong Shipyard of the UK, one of which was the Jing Yuan. The other ship was the Zhi Yuan, which was discovered in 2015 in the Huanghai Sea off Northwest China's Liaoning Province.Â
