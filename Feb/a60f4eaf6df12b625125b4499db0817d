The enforcement falls under the UFLPA signed by US President Joe Biden in late 2021. Considering that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is reportedly planning a China visit in the near future, it is not surprising that the US has suddenly intensified its crackdown on Xinjiang products, Wang Jiang, an expert at the Institute of China's Borderland Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, told the Global Times. "The US has once again pulled a card out of nowhere to pressure China, a routine tactic in US diplomacy."However, since the US passed the UFLPA, it has never presented proof of even a single case involving "forced labor" in Xinjiang, but only "a presumption of guilt," Wang noted."Judging from the current market situation, I am confident that the domestic Chinese market is capable of absorbing most of the aluminum and aluminum products from Xinjiang… The local government is also expected to issue some policies to help the affected companies."The US is trying to force China out of the global industrial chain, but not only is this difficult to do, its excessively high costs are also ultimately passed on to consumers, especially those in the US, observers noted.The expert noted that Xinjiang has recently organized a series of site visits by foreign dignitaries, especially officials from countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, giving many countries a glimpse of what is really going on in Xinjiang, even with the stigma imposed by the US. "As the US tries to revamp its supply chain, China is adjusting its markets accordingly to ensure its quality products find a new outlet," Wang said.
