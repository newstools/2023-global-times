The US propaganda war in spreading disinformation on the so-called China's military backing for Russia has apparently run into a wall as the EU and its member states seemingly did not buy it - the EU leader said "no evidence" of the "arms aid" claims and German head revealed Beijing's assurance on not sending arms to Russia.Chinese analysts believe that against the backdrop of visits and upcoming visits to China by European leaders, the relations between China and Europe are likely to be further enhanced, which goes against the US' expectation. So Washington is hyping the "Chinese military backing for Russia" based on inference of guilt in an attempt to drive the wedge between Beijing and Brussels, but it is doomed to fail, analysts said.According to the Politico, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday said China had declared it won't supply Russia with weapons, suggesting that "Berlin has received bilateral assurances from Beijing on the issue."Scholz was speaking at a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told reporters that the EU has received "no evidence" so far from the US that Beijing is considering supplying lethal support to Moscow, the Politico reported.Groundless rumors of "Chinese military backing for Russia" have swirled around since late February when White House national security adviser Jack Sullivan told CNN that China aiding Russia would be "a bad mistake" and CIA Director Bill Burns expressed confidence with the CBS News that China "is considering the provision of lethal equipment" to Russia.But Both Sullivan and Burns admitted that there's no evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment from China to Russia.The US hypes are more than the "inference of guilt" but a "blackmail," which has seriously violated the normal laws and principles of international relations, said Gao Jian, director of the Center for European Think Tank Studies at Shanghai International Studies University.Through such hypes, Washington is trying to damage Beijing's reputation and negate Beijing's consistent position of promoting peace talks amid the Ukraine crisis. Also, it is attempting to create public opinion pressure to hinder the series of potential China visits by European leaders, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times.After President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko paid a state visit to China from February 28 to March 2, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to visit China in early April. Also, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel may visit China in the first half of 2023 with preparations already underway, Chinese Ambassador to the EU Fu Cong told the Global Times in an exclusive interview previously.Gao told the Global Times on Monday that it is in line with common sense and based on matter-of-fact attitude for Europe to adopt such a position that does not blindly follow the US in response to the "Chinese arms aid" rumors.Â During the yearlong Russia-Ukraine conflict, Europe is one of the most direct victims of the crisis while the US has been the biggest beneficiary who is on the way to hollow out Europe economically, militarily and on energy, Gao said.So Europe has learnt that the US cannot be counted on to truly resolve the Ukraine crisis. In this sense, more European leaders have revealed their potential visits to China and hope that China can play a positive role in promoting peace talks in the conflict, analysts said.However, although the Europe is rethinking the future of its relationship with China and with the US and trying to strengthen its diplomatic independence, it is still facing a very severe test, as the pressure from the US and within Europe is mounting, analysts said, noting that there are still some divergences on issues of diplomatic strategy on China within the Europe.
