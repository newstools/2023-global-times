He didn't mention the ages of the three tigers.The zoo explained in its statement that the rescue work lasted for hours, but they failed to save one tiger cub as the pond is large (543.5 square meters) and deep (2 meters) and there is some thick mud inside it."We feel deeply sad about it," the zoo said, adding that it will learn from this and improve its emergency response plans.The zoo released the tigers out of their cages that day, as outdoor activities are good for them, the zoo told The Paper earlier on Thursday.
