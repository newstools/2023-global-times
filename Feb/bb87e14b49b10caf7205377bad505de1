This is the general direction," Tian said, noting that the current political environment is not beneficial to breeding concrete cooperation. Despite the need for cooperation, some US officials have continued to smear China's economic development. According to Tian, such criticisms are made from political perspectives instead of out of wishes to improve bilateral or global trade.
