National Museum of China Photo: VCGCompilation of Classics in the Flourishing Age More than 1,700 paintings dating from China's Qin Dynasty (221BC-206BC) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) are now on display at the National Museum of China in Beijing, presenting a vivid image of the development and evolution of Chinese art over the centuries to visitors. The three sections of the Compilation of Classics in the Flourishing Age exhibition seek to show, through some of China's best art treasures, how generations of artists have passed down China's art legacy while constantly innovating on what has come before. These ideas are presented through images, texts and also new media videos. According to staff at the National Museum of China, the Compilation of Classics in the Flourishing Age, and the ongoing Harmonious: Co-existence exhibition launched by the Palace Museum and the National Museum of China, have been the two most popular exhibitions during the recent holiday period. H.R. Giger x Sorayama: ApproachingThis two-person exhibition of art from Swiss artist Hans Ruedi Giger and Japanese illustrator Hajime Sorayama is currently being held at the UCCA Lab in Beijing's 798 Art Zone. The show features a total of 45 artworks across mediums like sculptures, airbrush paintings and installations. The exhibition seeks to establish an artistic dialogue to draw out the commonalities and contrasts between the two artists' practices and encourages viewers to imagine the futuristic worlds they present in their art from multiple perspectives. Exhibition curator Men Jiecong told the Global Times that the show aims to be a "meditation on the relationships between life, nature and technology."The exhibition is scheduled to last until March 24.
