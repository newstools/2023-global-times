the Scandinavian Tourist Board and the Norwegian Seafood Council (NSC) jointly
held the Norwegian Froztventure in Shanghai on Friday, in a bid to promote
Norway's tourism resources and seafood.With the rapid rebound of the Chinese economy, Norway
is hoping to further tap the consumption potential of the Chinese market. During the Norwegian Froztventure event, Lise Nordgaard,
Consul General of Norway in Shanghai, shared with the media and business
community what Norwegian tourism is about by introducing what people can do in
summer and winter in Norway. Also at the event, the NSC announced the launch
of the 3rd Norwegian Arctic Cod Festival, which is a one-month integrated
marketing campaign for Norwegian Arctic cod. In the coming month, consumers
will be able to experience tastings and cooking demos at some supermarkets across
nine cities to learn more. Statistics from the NSC showed that Chinese
consumers are becoming increasingly receptive of Norwegian seafood. In 2022,
Norwegian seafood exports to China exceeded 180,000 tons, up 8 percent
year-on-year. The value of seafood exports exceeded 7.25 billion Norwegian
kroner ($714 million), up 45 percent year-on-year. Global Times
