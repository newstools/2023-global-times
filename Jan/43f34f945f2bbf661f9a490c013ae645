Antibiotics such as norfloxacin have no effect on viral diarrhea and may increase the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, allergies and drug resistance," an industry insider, who works for a supplier of pharmaceutical excipients, told the Global Times on Monday on the condition of anonymity.It is more important to prevent dehydration and disturbance of water and electrolyte balance during diarrhea, the insider noted.However, the insider also said that the lack of montmorillonite powder is temporary and its supply will quickly resume just like the supply of fever, cough and other drugs.At present, the supply of antipyretic drugs, Lianhua Qingwen, N95 masks, antigen self-testing kits, thermometers, oxygen generators, and relevant drugs has been fully restored on e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, according to a statement sent from Tmall to the Global Times on Monday.According to Tmall, the daily supply of antigen test kits has more than doubled, and the 48-hour delivery rate of antiviral medicines has risen to 80 percent, and is expected to return to normal levels next week.The minimum price of N95 masks has been restored to 2 yuan ($0.29) per piece, and the minimum price of a single antigen self-testing kit has been reduced to less than 5 yuan on online platforms.Yang Yongsen, a business manager at Lepu Medical Technology (Beijing) Co, said that at present, the production capacity of the company's antigen self-testing products is 10 million per day, which is expected to continue to grow in the coming weeks. The company, together with Tmall, will guarantee the online supply of antigen products.Â In response to the short-term surge in demand for drugs, Tmall said that it has cooperated with dozens of pharmaceutical brands such as Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings Co., Andon Health Co., Cofoe Medical Technology Co. and other companies to increase production and expand capacity to ensure the production and supply of key anti-COVID products."From the perspective of the whole country, the peak of COVID-19 infections is expected to be from mid-January to early February, so fever drugs are still in need," said the insider.
