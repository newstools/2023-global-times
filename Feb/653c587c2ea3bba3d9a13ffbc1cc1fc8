The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy’s aircraft carrier Shandong conducts realistic combat-oriented exercises in the South China Sea in the early autumn of 2022.

For instance, it’s highly likely that the Shandong had a close encounter with a US aircraft carrier in the South China Sea, military experts said.“This is Chinese navy warship 17,” a crew member hailed in both Chinese and English in a short video of the Shandong conducting actual combat training in the South China Sea, showing J-15 fighter jets flying around the clock.“It gives people an overwhelming sense of security,” the Chinese navy described the Shandong’s words on its official WeChat account.In 2021, the Type 055 large destroyer Nanchang went abroad for the first time to participate in the China-Russia maritime joint exercise and cruise. During the joint cruise, the soldiers of Nanchang called down to foreign ships and aircraft followed in English: "I am a Chinese Navy 101, I am sailing, keep a safe distance from me.”Song Zhongping,  a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) warships and warplanes need to speak English when they encounter foreign warships and aircraft.He believes it's possible the Shandong has had a close encounter with a US aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. “Normally, aircraft carriers from different countries always keep a safe distance once they meet on the high seas,” said Song, adding that helicopters and ships from both sides will keep watch around each other's carrier and tell each other who they are and what they are sailing for without hostility.In addition, the expert said there are two possible situations for shouting that could have occurred when the Shandong is on duty. One situation is that foreign warships and planes are close to the drill area when the Chinese warships and planes are conducting drills. The Chinese military needs to call out to inform them that if they enter the drill area, they will force them to drive away. On the other hand, the PLA navy will also call out foreign warships and aircraft to leave and stay away from sensitive waters, such as the Nansha and Xisha Islands.Song believes the phrase "an overwhelming sense of security" shows that the PLA Navy always has the determination and courage to fight and win, regardless of whether the US military sends aircraft carriers or not, or how many aircraft carriers are sent to the South China Sea. It is worth noting that the US 7th Fleet announced on February 12 that the US Navy and Marine Corps, led by the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, are conducting joint exercises in the South China Sea. This is the second time this year that the carrier strike group has entered the South China Sea.On January 14, the official account of the PLA Navy also released the latest shots of the Shandong’s training in the South China Sea, showing that the carrier, consisting of ships and fighter jets of different types, is preparing for a real combat exercise.Military experts believe that this “coincidence" shows the importance of Shandong's deployment in the South China Sea. Song said that it is an inevitable military task and one of its important military missions for Shandong to perform its duty as a combat ship in the South China Sea.
