This type of second-generation fighter jet was used by the PLA Air Force and the aviation force of the PLA Navy, the CCTV report said.The complete decommissioning procedure of the J-7 was initiated in 2018, and units that still fly the jet will accelerate this process this year, CCTV said.China's production capacity of new aircraft has been increasing, and the number of J-7 fighter jets remaining in active service is now low, Du Wenlong, a Chinese military expert, said in the report.According to this fast pace, the J-7 will likely be retired from combat service of the PLA Air Force this year, Du said.China has been building 4.5-generation fighter jets like the J-10C and J-16 as well as the fifth-generation fighter jet J-20 in large numbers, and they will eventually replace legacy fighter jets like the J-7, experts said.As of the end of December last year, major Chinese military aircraft manufacturers announced completion of their annually scheduled production plans, which observers said laid a solid foundation for the aviation forces of the PLA in 2023.Wei Dongxu, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times that the J-7 fighter jets significantly contributed to China's air defense, and many variants including the JL-9 trainer jet were developed based on the J-7.The J-7 also sold well on the international market, Wei said.The retired J-7s could be reserved for training and testing, or they could be modified to become drones and play new roles in modern warfare, analysts said.J-7 fighter jets were among the PLA aircraft that were spotted flying near the island of Taiwan in an exercise in June 2021, said the defense authority on the island at the time, specifically noting that those J-7s were not drones.
