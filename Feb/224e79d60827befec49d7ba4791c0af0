The relics unearthed from the tombs have revealed that the region was the fiefdom of a noble family, thus providing more materials for research into China's ancient feudal system.Roughly 800,000 square meters in size, the ruins site, which is divided into different areas such as a living area and grand cemetery, spans the time from the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046BC-771BC) to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770BC-256BC). The tombs were built during the late Western Zhou Dynasty to early Eastern Zhou Dynasty, researchers from the Shaanxi Academy of Archaeology told the Global Times on Monday.The tombs are uniform in shape, with the largest measuring 36.6 meters in length. Archaeologists found one to three human skeletons that were buried alive along with the deceased in six of the tombs. Some fragments of pottery wares as well as carts and the skeletons of horses were also unearthed from the tombs.

The inscriptions on these bronze wares reveal that the graves and cultural relics belonged to the Jing family, a noble family with important officials in the Zhou Dynasty government.Judging by the tombs' age, design, burial objects and inscriptions, archaeologists speculated that the region around the ruins site was originally a fiefdom belonging to the Jing family.
