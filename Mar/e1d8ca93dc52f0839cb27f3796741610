"A pilot should jump out of his own perspective in aerial combat [...] and put himself in a system of joint operation, contributing more to winning as a whole," he said.Zhang Xiao, another NPC deputy who is also a fighter jet pilot, proposed that artificial intelligence be integrated into command chains, China Central Television (CCTV) reported.The computer can sum up all situational information and assist military personnel in making more efficient and accurate decisions, said Zhang, who is among China's first group of female fighter jet pilots. She pilots the JH-7 fighter bomber and has carried out alert patrol missions over the East China Sea, according to CCTV.Both Gao and Zhang are the PLA Air Force's top pilots, conducting missions on the frontiers of China's air defense with the country's main combat weaponry, and their motions to the NPC show that digitalization, informatization and intelligentization are major focuses in the modernization of the Chinese armed forces, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on Thursday, requesting anonymity.In future warfare, all weaponry will likely become interconnected through a fast, stable and efficient communications network, and all the vast data will likely be preprocessed, selected and highlighted by artificial intelligence before being presented to human operators, so the latter can make the best decisions for victory, the expert said.
