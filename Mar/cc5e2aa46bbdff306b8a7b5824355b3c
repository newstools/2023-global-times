Through this special action, the province's awareness of running and managing mines will be further enhanced, read the plan.The plan mandates faster construction of green mines, stronger ecological restoration of mines, regulated production and operation of mining enterprises, and security of the industry and supply chains.The special action will run through the end of October 2023, striving to achieve a significant improvement in the order of mineral resources exploration and development, the mining ecological environment, and the layout of the industry and supply chain. "The plan indicates that China has strengthened the importance of protecting mineral resources, and the country will strictly punish illegal and unplanned mining of rare earths and other resources," Wu Chenhui, an independent industry analyst who follows the rare-earth industry, told the Global Times on Sunday.Jiangxi is home to major reserves of non-ferrous metals and rare metal ores. According to the statistics from the Ministry of Natural Resources in 2021, the province has 6.66 million tons of copper ore reserves, 1.21 million tons of lead ore reserves and 1.87 million tons of zinc ore reserves.Yichun, with the world's largest reserves of lithium mica ore, is called "Asia's lithium capital." However, at the beginning of this year, some media outlets reported that local people were extracting the "white stone," an alternative name for lepidolite, the raw material of lithium, to sell it in the burgeoning new-energy industry. The investigation led to a thorough scrutiny of the mining sector in the region, with some miners suspended from operation indefinitely.Wu noted that the increased protection of local resources such as tungsten, rare earths and lithium will help ensure healthy development of the local mining industry."Green and sustainable development of the industry should be in accordance with national development goals, so the regulation is needed to promote the healthier development of the industry," Wu said.Global Times
