Illustration:Liu Rui/GTThe Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress issued a statement on Monday in response to the US Senate's adoption of a resolution concerning the Chinese unmanned airship, noting that it is another wrong move to distort facts and an attempt to put pressure on China. According to the statement, the resolution passed by the US House of Representatives claiming that “China used a high-altitude surveillance balloon over US territory” and sensationalizing the “China threat” theory is nothing but malicious hype and political manipulation.China is a responsible country that adheres to international law and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations. China has no intention of violating the territory and airspace of any sovereign country, the statement said.The statement explains that the incursion of a Chinese civilian unmanned airship into US airspace was entirely accidental and caused by force majeure. Moreover, it emphasizes that the incident did not pose any threat to US personnel or security interests. China responded responsibly to the situation.However, the US insisted on using force and created a disturbance deliberately. This act seriously violated the spirit of international law and international norms. “Some politicians in the US Congress are utilizing the issue to fan the flames, fully exposing their sinister intention to contain China," it said. The statement emphasizes that building China-US relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation serves the fundamental interests of both peoples and is the common expectation of the international community.The statement strongly urges the US Congress to respect the facts, the spirit of international law, and  the fundamental principles of international relations. China calls on the US to immediately stop slandering and smearing China and refrain from taking any actions that could escalate situations.
