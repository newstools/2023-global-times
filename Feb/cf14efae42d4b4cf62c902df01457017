The session was held in Geneva from February 27 to April 4. In his speech, Qin pointed out that the global human rights career faces severe challenges due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, global economic recession, food and energy crisis, breaking of industrial chains, and climate change.He emphasized that each country's right to choose its own path to develop human rights must be respected. He also stressed that unilateral coercive measures must be immediately and unconditionally abolished."The key reason why China has made historic achievements in promoting its human rights cause is that China adheres to the path which kept abreast of the trend of the times and suited its own national conditions", Qin pointed out.Qin stated that China opposes the politicization of human rights issues and interference in other countries' affairs in the name of human rights. He called for fairness, justice, dialogue, and cooperation in the UNHRC.As some forces with ulterior motives have been hyping up matters relating to China's Xinjiang and Xizang regions, Qin invited people without bias to come to China and witness the facts and truth with their own eyes.Qin also emphasized that the decision the Japanese government made to dump Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean concerned the global ecological environment and the health of people in all countries, urging Japan to deal with the water in an open, transparent, scientific and secure manner.Global Times
