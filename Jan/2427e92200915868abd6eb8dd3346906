Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said on Friday that US is working with allies and partners to "preserve a peaceful, free and open Indo-Pacific." Top US political leaders are aware that playing up such imprudent remarks will cause further damage to China-US relations, and even make China-US hostility become a "self-fulfilling prophecy," Xin said.The Pentagon official's attitude shows that they know the importance of maintaining the stability of China-US relations, he added. Experts said it cannot be ruled out that the US is trying to "deter China" by using the "irritation-clarification and de-escalation" approach, which occurred in Biden's several "slips of tongue" over the confirmation of US military interference in the Taiwan question. Given the provocation came before Blinken's possible China tour in February, some analysts believe that the US intends on using such military leverage for more gains in the bilateral discussions. Chinese military expert Song Zhongping believes that by hyping the "threats" posed by China's military, the US general is probably trying to get more military spending for his command.Although the Pentagon strives for balance in its budget allocation, commands will always ask for more military expenditure, including for training and equipment, to increase combat effectiveness, Song told the Global Times on Saturday. The AMC, according to US media, has nearly 50,000 service members and nearly 500 planes and is responsible for transport and refueling.Public information shows that before taking over at the AMC in 2021, Minihan served in a variety of Pacific-related roles since 2013, including as deputy commander of Indo-Pacific Command from September 2019 to August 2021.Analysts said that military personnel are generally cautious and avoid being imprudent when it comes to the risks of a real war because they are, after all, the ones who have to bleed on the frontline. But there are always some "super-hawkish war maniacs" in the military, especially at a time when many in the US are trying to win support by joining a race to show a tougher stance on China.
