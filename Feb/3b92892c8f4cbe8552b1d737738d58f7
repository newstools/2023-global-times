And the composition of district councils may not necessarily be formed only through direct elections in districts. However, whether to reintroduce the appointment system or use other methods, such as the proportion of directly elected seats, are topics that need to be discussed and reviewed while the most important thing is to underscore executive leadership, according to media reports.When it comes to the situation of Hong Kong, John Lee, chief executive of the HKSAR government, told at a press conference on Tuesday that he hopes to the legislation of the Article 23 could be finalized within this year or next year.  Lee emphasized that the HKSAR has the constitutional responsibility to enact the Article 23 of the Basic Law as soon as possible. Currently, society may not fully grasp the seriousness of the issues targeted by the legislation as the national security risks have been changing frequently with growingly complex international relations. There are possibilities that the national security risks are still lurking in the city, which requires the consolidation of multifaceted mechanisms for safeguarding national security.Some experts believed that disclosure of information about the meeting between central government and HKSAR government officials showed that the central government increased the transparency in its Hong Kong and Macao-related work."It also shows that the central government is fully implementing its full administrative power and focusing on One Country, Two Systems," Lau Siu-kai, a consultant from the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies who is also a senior policy advisor, told the Global Times on Tuesday. It is also normal for the central government to pay attention to the review of local administrative structure when it comes to the review of district councils, Lau noted. "Local district councils should not become a political battleground and they are not simply providing consultation to the local government but need to mobilize community to improve people's livelihoods," he said.
