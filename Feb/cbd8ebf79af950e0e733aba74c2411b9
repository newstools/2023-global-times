A week earlier, the US and Germany said that they would provide Ukraine with offensive tanks. Dai pointed out that willful sanctions and artificial blocking of the flow of industrial and supply chains will only exacerbate the rippling effect of the Ukraine crisis, and inflict heavy cost on the whole world, especially on developing countries. "All parties concerned should manage the spillover effect on global food, energy and financial security in a responsible manner," he said.The Chinese diplomat emphasized the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine, calling for an immediate stop of shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and maximum efforts to stop the conflict from escalating to a nuclear crisis. "We support International Atomic Energy Agency to remain engaged with Russia and Ukraine over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant issue to reach meaningful arrangements acceptable to both sides as soon as possible," said Dai?Dai stressed that China always stands on the side of peace, dialogue and humanity and ready to work with the international community to peacefully resolve the crisis.
