Photo: VCGA spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Japan on Tuesday urged the Japanese side to return to a scientific and objective stance, stop politicizing epidemic prevention and create safe, healthy and orderly exchanges between people from both countries.Some countries, including Japan, are imposing new measures or even discriminatory restrictions on travelers from China, citing concerns that the current surge of COVID-19 cases in China could lead to the emergence of new variants.The current development of the epidemic situation in China is expected to be under control, with many places across the country having passed the peak of the infections and speeding up to return to normal, said the spokesperson, adding that the Chinese government has made the scientific assessment and necessary preparations, which will enable the country to pass this period of adjustment in a smooth and orderly way.China took the initiative to optimize and adjust its epidemic prevention and control measures in light of the current situation in early December, gradually shifting the focus from preventing infection to preventing severe disease and death, the spokesperson noted.The spokesperson said that China has always shared its related data in a timely, open and transparent manner, and is willing to continue to share the genetic sequences of its COVID-19 cases with the WHO and the Global Influenza Sharing Database, aiming to make important contributions to the vaccine and medical research and development.Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the Chinese government has always put people's health and life first, and effectively coordinated epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development.Over the past three years, China has administered nearly 3.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine, accounting for 92.9 percent of the total population, and its severe illness and mortality rates are among the lowest in the world.The Chinese economy has maintained an average annual growth rate of about 4.5 percent, which is significantly higher than the world average, and has made important contributions to stabilizing the global production and supply chain and the supply of anti-epidemic materials, and promoting the recovery of the world economy.The scientific and rationality of China's optimization and adjustment of epidemic prevention measures have been recognized by many countries, with many medical experts saying that there is no need to put restrictions on travelers from China.Japan and a few other countries still insist on increasing entry restrictions on travelers from China, which is not grounded in science and has caused strong dissatisfaction in the Chinese society, the spokesperson said, adding that China has the right to take corresponding and reciprocal measures.Global Times
