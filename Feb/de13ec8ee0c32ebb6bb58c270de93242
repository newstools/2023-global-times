Under this mechanism, carbon reduction could be achieved through the low-carbon behavior of the public and small and micro enterprises as they can offset their own carbon emissions, participate in carbon trading, or be transformed into other more diverse incentives. Carbon inclusion has become an important way to reduce carbon emissions at the consumer end, as well as an important way to guide the public to participate in a green life and an important starting point for implementing China’s goals of seeking to hit its carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.In recent years, local governments and companies have launched dozens of carbon inclusion platforms of carbon accounts and seen achievements.For instance, according to the report, during the Beijing2022 Winter Olympics, the organizing committee worked with several companies, such as Meituan and Baidu, attracting about 2.7 million people to participate in low-carbon behavior to reduce 30,000 tons of carbon emissions in total.The report put forward suggestions and prospects for the government, enterprises, and social organizations to carry out carbon inclusion, urging them to further guide the public to adopt a low-carbon lifestyle and the construction of carbon inclusion platforms.
