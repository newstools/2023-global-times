In a scent search professional subject examination in July 2022, under the continuous interference of the trainer, “Yingkong” took less than 15 seconds to find something suspicious in nearly 200 square meters of space, setting a record in this subject. Up to now, “Yingkong” has assisted the police in seizing four drug cases and surrendered 73.86 kilograms of drugs, becoming a meritorious dog.“They are soldiers’ ‘silent comrade-in-arms,’ close partners of the immigration control police, and they deserve people’s protection and respect,” a netizen said. “Hopefully, more police dogs could be named meritorious dogs,” another noted.
