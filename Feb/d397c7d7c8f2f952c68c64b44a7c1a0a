The first completed a flight test on the land on May 31, 2022, and another test on the water on August 29, 2022, according to the AVIC. Codenamed Kunlong, or "water dragon" in Chinese, the AG600 aircraft family is being developed to serve emergency rescue missions. It can be used in forest firefighting, maritime search and rescue, and other critical emergency rescue missions.A member of the AG600 family, the AG600M is specifically designed to combat forest fires. Its maximum take-off weight is 60 tons, with a water-carrying capacity of up to 12 tons and flight range of up to 4,500 kilometers. It can conduct low-altitude flying at low speed, enabling it to drop water accurately on fire sites.This year is key for the development of AG600 aircraft. Aiming to make progress toward securing the airworthiness certification for the firefighting variant in 2024 and for the rescue variant in 2025, the aircraft will be subjected to a series of tests in 2023, the Chinese manufacturer confirmed.
