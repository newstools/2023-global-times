She said that the cold winter of the epidemic has dissipated and the cross-Straits deadlock should be eased as well. She hopes the DPP authorities will stop using all means to obstruct cross-Straits exchanges and stop ignoring the rights and interests of Taiwan businesspeople.There are millions of Taiwan businessmen and compatriots on the mainland, and they need a peaceful and stable environment across the Straits, Hung said after she visited Xiamen for discussions with Taiwan businessmen during the Spring Festival holidays.Wang Kwo-tsai, senior official of the transportation and communications authority in the island, said on Tuesday that the island has set a goal of attracting 6 million overseas travelers this year, 1 million of whom would be mainland residents, Taiwan media reported. On the same day, Taiwan vowed to cancel PCR sampling for COVID-19 tests from inbound passengers from the mainland as of February 7, but arrivals still need to undergo a seven-day period of self-initiated prevention, according to the Taiwan health department.A Taiwan resident surnamed Chu who travels between Shanghai and Taipei for business told the Global Times that, for Taiwan residents living in Shanghai, they can take direct flights to the island. But it will be good news for residents in other cities, especially for those involved in cross-Straits marriages, Chu said.Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Chengdu have always supported direct flights, but the number is limited and fares are high. For example, the round trip between Shanghai and Taipei costs about 3,600 yuan ($534), Chu said. The cross-Straits shipping and flight services will facilitate exchanges between people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, based on the one-China principle. However, since cross-Straits relations took a turn for the worse after Tsai Ing-wen took office in the island, coupled with the pandemic, there are only four direct flight destinations on the mainland, and most flights are basically suspended, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Thursday.To resume direct flights will surely signal the easing and improvement of cross-Straits relations, and show that the mainland hopes to continue to promote the integrated development of the two sides, the observer noted.However, considering the past moves by the DDP authorities to block cross-Straits exchanges, it is likely to be a "bumpy and tortuous" process to resume direct flights to the 16 mainland destinations, Xin pointed out.To restore direct flights requires goodwill and support from the mainland and cooperation from the Taiwan authorities. But Tsai has always been stigmatizing and demonizing exchanges between the two sides as the re-warming of cross-Straits ties goes against her intention to seek "Taiwan independence."Ferries between Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen and the mainland city of Xiamen restarted on January 7 after a hiatus of almost three years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the current resumption of services with Kinmen and Matsu has been scheduled to last only until February 6, and it's restricted to residents of the two small Taiwan islands, mainland spouses and students studying in Kinmen, media reports said.
