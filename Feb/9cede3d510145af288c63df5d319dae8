The mode imposes restrictions for minors’ usage from online time to service functions.  The strengthened management shows that the nation’s supervision of relevant sectors has shifted to a regular management phase, with a more mature regulation system gradually being formed, Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent tech analyst, told the Global Times on Monday.According to a report issued by China Youth & Children Research Center, some 65.6 percent of the surveyed minors watch short-videos, while 20 percent of minors said that they “always” watch short videos, China Youth Daily reported.   Data from the China Internet Network Information Center showed that as of June 2022, the number of users of China’s short-video products reached 962 million, accounting for 91.5 percent of the number of total internet users, while users under the age of 19 reached 186 million, accounting for 17.7 percent of the total users.  In addition to short videos, the authorities have ramped up efforts to prevent minors from becoming addicted to online games as well.China's National Press and Publication Administration, which is in charge of licensing video games in China, released a notice in August 2021 requiring online game providers to offer only one-hour services to minors from 8 pm to 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, as well as on official holidays, aiming to prevent online gaming addiction among minors.
