China’s COVID situation is under control and many European Union (EU) member states have expressed a wish to warmly welcome Chinese travelers. The EU should listen to rational voices and view China’s epidemic situation in an objective manner, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Fri in response to the EU’s suggestion to impose travel restrictions on travelers from China."China has taken the initiative to adjust and optimize epidemic prevention and control measures based on scientific assessments," Mao said. Professional institutions including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control earlier said that it’s unjustified to consider screenings and travel measures on travelers from China, Mao noted. China has been sharing information and data with the international community in an open and transparent manner, and has conducted over 60 technical exchanges with the World Health Organization (WHO). China has also been sharing the genome data of the virus from new COVID-19 cases in China via the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), providing an important reference for international health research institutions, Mao pointed out.China has stressed many times that for all countries, COVID response measures need to be science-based and proportionate, Mao said. The measures should not affect normal travel and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. They should not be used for political manipulation, and there should not be any discriminatory measures against China, Mao noted.In response to some countries’ unreasonable practices, China vowed to take corresponding measures based on the principle of reciprocity.
