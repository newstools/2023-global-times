The teachers have also shown the letter to the students in class, after which the students vowed to further strengthen their Chinese language skills to live up to Xi's encouraging expectations.Every year, graduates from the Hungarian-Chinese bilingual school are enrolled in some of China's most prestigious institutions of higher learning including Peking University and Tsinghua University, among others, for further studies.The Chinese language has been popular in Hungary for a while. Chinese is included in the Hungarian national education system, and students can choose Chinese as their first examinable foreign language in elementary and middle schools. Currently, there are five Confucius Institutes in Hungary, which have trained a large number of Chinese language professionals."This letter of reply is not only an affirmation of Chinese language teaching in the Hungarian-Chinese bilingual school, but also an affirmation of the cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," Zombory Klára, president of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association, said."More and more Hungarians are learning about the charms of traditional Chinese culture. At the same time, more and more Chinese people come to Hungary to work, study, or travel," she said, adding that Hungarian poet Sandor Petofi and architect László Hudec are also widely praised in China and have become Hungarian cultural icons .Cultural exchanges promote mutual understandingIn recent years, ever-deepening people-to-people exchanges between China and Hungary have become a highlight in the cooperation and communication between the two countries.Lengyel Bence is a Hungarian student who has been studying in China for four years and is currently studying for a master's degree at Renmin University of China in Beijing.Since 2022, he has been running a channel called "Tianyu in China" on social media platforms, documenting and sharing his experiences in China from the perspective of a Hungarian student, which has been widely praised by Hungarian netizens."I saw many friends are reposting the news report about President Xi's reply letter," he said. "As a participant in the cultural exchange between Hungary and China, I am also encouraged. Young people are the future of the long-standing friendship, and we can enhance it in various ways. The mutual understanding between the people of the two countries will continue to pass on the friendship between Hungary and China."According to the Chinese Embassy in Hungary, China and Hungary currently provide about 220 scholarships to each other every year to encourage student exchanges that allow young people from the two sides to study in each other's countries. Yang Chao, interim charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Hungary, said that the reply letter fully demonstrates that President Xi attaches great importance to strengthening people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and other countries, promoting people-to-people bonds, and promoting mutual understanding among civilizations from the perspective of building a community with a shared future for mankind. "The friendship between the two countries lies in the friendship between the peoples," Yang said. The relationship between the two countries needs the support of the people and will ultimately serve the people," he said. "The better the people of China and Hungary understand each other and visit each other, the stronger the foundation of the friendship between the two countries and the more prosperous the practical cooperation will be," he noted.After China optimized its virus prevention policies, cultural exchanges between China and Hungary will usher in new opportunities. China has started a pilot program allowing national travel agencies and online travel companies to resume the outbound group tours for Chinese citizens.Hungary is among the first 20 countries to open up to the pilot program. At present, the three direct flights between the two countries have been fully restored. Zoltán Guller, chairman of the Board of the Hungarian Tourism Agency, said that "Hungary is very much looking forward to the arrival of Chinese tourists, and we are full of expectations for deepening cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries."
