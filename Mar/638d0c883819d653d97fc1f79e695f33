For instance, the issue of offshore yuan local government bonds helps raise local funds and leverage foreign capital," Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday.Another highlight of the plan is to promote financial opening and innovation in Hengqin, Qianhai and Nansha.Hengqin will accelerate the construction of a digital fence system, and the Macao banking and insurance sectors are encouraged to set up branches in the Hengqin Cooperation Zone. Qianhai will accelerate the construction of the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong International Financial City, and make it a pilot in the fields of foreign exchange management reform and yuan internationalization. The province will promote trade, investment and financing facilitation in Nansha, exploring the expansion of two-way financial opening and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao in the capital market, green finance and other areas.Dong noted that these targeted measures will promote the integration of the mainland with the two SARs through the GBA by taking advantage of local strengths and boosting growth."For instance, through financial cooperation, Macao can expand the geographical development space of its financial services industry in Hengqin, and Hengqin can absorb Macao's high added-value industries and attract talent," the expert said.On February 23, 2023, the People's Bank of China (PBC), China's central bank, along with four other authorities, jointly issued two guidelines to provide stronger financial support for the construction and development of the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in the Hengqin and Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.A total of 30 new measures will be issued for each region, covering a wide range of aspects from financial market interconnection and promotion of cross-border trade to strengthening financial supervision."Hong Kong and Macao are the frontier and bridgehead of China's economic opening-up, and using the advantages of the two SARs to carry out high-quality cooperation with the Chinese mainland may be an important step this year," Dong noted.Shenzhen and Hong Kong funds can have more room for cooperation and development in the exchange business, and talent exchanges will also be the focus of cooperation, the expert added.Global Times
