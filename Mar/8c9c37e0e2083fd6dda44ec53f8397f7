According to monitoring by the China Index Academy (CIA), as many as 30 cities reduced the floor for mortgage interest rates for first-time homebuyers to below 4 percent.Since January, property policies have continued to ease, and some second-tier cities continued to announce favorable policies. At the same time, demand increased and more consumers said that they expected to buy homes, which led to the increase in sales, said Liu Yong, chief researcher at the CIA. "Housing sales in March will continue to grow vigorously," said Liu.Global Times
