This intensive sortie rate set a record, surpassing the Liaoning's drills in the West Pacific in May 2022 with over 300 aircraft sorties in some 20 days.By including two Type 055 large destroyers for the first time, observers said the flotilla is by far the most powerful Liaoning aircraft carrier group.It is also the first time the Chinese aircraft carrier was spotted operating near Guam, meaning that the record-breaking voyage not only broke the first island chain, but also reached the second island chain, analysts said.The Liaoning is not meant to stay in homeport, and drills in the far sea have become regular and routine, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times.The Liaoning carrier group has formed complete combat and support capabilities with enhanced vessel-aircraft interoperability, and China now has the comprehensive capability to seize air supremacy and control of the sea far away from its homeland, Song said.Such trainings will also garner valuable experiences and train talent for other Chinese aircraft carriers, including the country's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, another Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times.The Fujian aims to conduct tests and sea trials in 2023, Senior Captain Qian Shumin, executive officer of the Fujian, said on China Central Television on Monday.
