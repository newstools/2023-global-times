The survey results showed that 98.7 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises said they would maintain and expand their investment in China, and 89.8 percent said they would maintain their industrial chain in the country.Foreign companies surveyed generally believed that China's economy is resilient and overall has strong competitive advantages in terms of market potential, industrial system, infrastructure and business environment. According to the survey, 91 percent of the foreign enterprises and business associations are very supportive of China's policy to optimize epidemic prevention and control. Some 99.4 percent of the foreign firms are more confident in China's economic development prospects in 2023.Global Times
