During the past decade, Xi has made a number of major proposals and initiatives, including building a global community with shared future and building of the Belt and Road Initiative, which hold the core of countries to depend each other of existence, share a common destiny and urge cooperation across international society, said Qin, when asked about China’s role in strengthening and improving global governance at the press conference. Cooperation can triumph over COVID-19, address climate change and solve deficits of peace, security, development and governance, said Qin. Ancient wisdom tells us that global governance should stick to law, stick to the spirit of international law embodied by the United Nations Charter and uphold justice and oppose hegemonism.The combined population of developing countries accounts for 80 percent of the global population, and contributes 70 percent of global economic output,  Qin said. People from developing countries deserve better lives, and developing countries should have greater voice in international affairs. China will stick to participate global affairs actively and contribute more on peaceful development of world and progress of humanity, the foreign minister stressed. Global Times
