Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning Photo:fmprc.gov.cn China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday that the US' abuse of export restrictions against China will affect the efficiency and stability of global industrial and supply chains, which may also lead itself to a dead end.Mao made the remark at a regular press conference in response to a media question over reports that the US government secured a deal with the Netherlands and Japan on chip-making equipment export controls against China, by intensifying pressure on its allies.The US' abuse of export bans was intended to protect its own interests and its global hegemony, and try to form a small group of countries against China, said Mao. "China resolutely opposes the politicization and weaponization of technology trade. These moves will damage market rules and global trade order, which are harmful for other countries including the US itself, and also the stability of global industrial and supply chains," she said.Mao said that there had been anxious reactions to the move from the international society. Many industry observers warned that the abuse of export curbs by the US will affect the efficiency of international business, and the attempt to isolate others will finally block the US itself. China will follow up on the move and relevant issues to protect legal rights of the Chinese side, said Mao, and she appealed to relevant parties to respond wisely for the common benefit of international society over the long term. The US reached an agreement with the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of some advanced chip-making machinery to China, including advanced lithography tools, Bloomberg reported on Saturday.The deal would extend some export controls the US government adopted in October 2022 to multiple companies in the two countries, according to the report. The actual implementation of those restrictions could take months as the two countries finalize legal arrangements, the report said.Global Times
