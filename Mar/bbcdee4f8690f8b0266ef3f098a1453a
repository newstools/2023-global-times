At the Airshow China 2022, the AG600 large amphibious emergency rescue aircraft and the aerial tanker variant of the Y-20 also made flight performances, and China’s family of large aircraft is getting bigger, said the political advisor.The development of large aircraft reflects a country’s comprehensive capability, and when foreigners once asked Tang how China achieved the miracle of taking only five years to conduct the Y-20’s first flight and only eight years to deliver for service, Tang replied, “The key is self-reliance and innovation.”With the spirit of integration, innovation and dedication, China made many technological breakthroughs including digitalized design, digitalized manufacturing, simulations and coordinated network management, which also reflected technological advancements through time and high-quality development, Tang said.“We are on the long conquest toward a high level of technological development. In developing pillars of great power, we shall never stop our steps to explore and innovate. The aviation industry has not disappointed in serving the country. We must and will make new and bigger contributions to the country’s prosperity and the nation’s rejuvenation,” the chief designer said.
