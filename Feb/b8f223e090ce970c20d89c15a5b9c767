Anti domestic violence Photo:VCGA man suspected of cutting his wife's throat remains under administrative detention and may face criminal charges, according to police in Zhangjiajie in Centra China's Hunan Province on Wednesday evening.The Women's Federation in Zhangjiajie said it is aware of the case and is working with the court for the application of personal safety protection order to protect the woman.The response came after a social media post surfaced asking for help on Monday, in which a woman said her husband cut her throat with a knife on February 7, leaving her with a 16.5-centimeter-long wound along her neck, after she refused to forgive the man's repeated unfaithful behavior and asked for a divorce."The murderer has been detained by the police, but he will be released after 10 days. What can I do if he comes to me for revenge?" the woman said in the post, which triggered public outrage over the violence and concern for the woman's safety.Local police in Zhangjiajie's Yongding district said on Wednesday that the woman's claims over her injuries were true and the suspect was still under administrative detention as they need to wait for the woman's injury identification result before formally charging the suspect."We have informed the woman of the case's current process. Now she has calmed down and deleted the post," according to a police statement."This is clearly a case of domestic violence. If the woman's injury is identified as first-degree slight injury, the man will be punished in accordance to Public Security Penalties Law. If the injury is judged as the more serious third-degree severe or second-degree minor, the suspect will be held accountable for intentional injury under the Criminal Law," said Zhao Liangshan, a public interest lawyer and senior partner from Shaanxi Hengda Law FirmAccording to China's Anti-domestic Violence Law, an individual can seek a protection order from the court after suffering from or facing the threat of domestic violence.
