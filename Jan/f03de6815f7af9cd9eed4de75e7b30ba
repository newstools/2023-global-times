SIX Swiss Exchange Photo: VCGNine Chinese companies have been listed on the Swiss stock market since July 2022 and more are seeking listings, the SIX Swiss Exchange told the Global Times on Tuesday.Companies including Jiangsu Eastern Shenghong, Hangzhou Greatstar Industrial, Sunwoda Electronic, Joincare Pharmaceutical Group Industry and Lepu Medical Technology have listed Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The number expanded from the original four last July.The number of new listings showed that companies of Chinese origin that aim to grow their businesses to invest into Europe, either in services and products or in manufacturing, are finding it very interesting to raise capital in Switzerland and improve their visibility, the SIX Swiss Exchange told the Global Times in a written interview.Â "We have very deep liquidity pools and strong investors. Furthermore, the Swiss Exchange is the home of some of the most successful and biggest companies in Europe in terms of market capitalization," it said.Chinese companies have accelerated the pace of seeking listings in Switzerland with more than 20 having announced such plans, according to the SIX Swiss Exchange."We have seen interest among more companies that intend to list their GDRs on our exchange. About 20 companies have either already publicly announced their interest or are in the process of applying," it said.Since the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2019, the SIX Swiss Exchange has been working closely with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges to establish a China-Switzerland Stock Connect. The recent flurry of listings marks an important move in promoting the two-way opening-up of China's stock markets.At the Annual Conference of Financial Street Forum 2022 in November, China's financial policymakers sent new opening-up signals, saying that investors from all over the world are welcome to explore the Chinese market and collaborate with China in accelerating the global economic recovery.
