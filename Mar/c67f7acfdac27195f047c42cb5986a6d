She has been committed to the popularization of space knowledge for teenagers since 2003."By taking them to various satellite launch centers and exhibitions, the kids have not only learned more about China's space achievements but more importantly, the spirit of perseverance, innovation and selfless dedication," she said.These activities have strengthened their sense of national identity, and boosted their confidence and determination to integrate into the country's development, Chen noted."They used to believe that Macao, which lags behind in technology and education, has nothing to do with core technologies such as going into space. But now the youths of Macao have regained faith to devote themselves to scientific research field and take part in these national programs," Chen said.In 2019, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Macao's return to China, the China National Space Administration and the Macao SAR government jointly released the research and development of the SAR's first scientific satellite.The satellite, Aoke-1, is expected to be launched this year. It will be used for precise measurement of magnetic fields, the advisor said.What's more, Macao will be involved as China starts the selection process for the fourth batch of astronauts to join later manned space missions.The greater involvement in China's grand space development course is attracting more talent from Macao to join the aerospace industry as well as other related technology industries. They are looking forward to entering China's "space home" in the near future, Chen added.
