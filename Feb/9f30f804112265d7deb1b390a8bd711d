The focus will be on high-quality development, so as to better protect the environment and let people enjoy a more green and eco-friendly life, according to Ma.The plan also says that the demonstration zone must include at least 766,000 mu (51,066.67 hectares) of farmland by 2035, including no less than 665,400 mu of permanent farmland.The zone will promote innovative measures to build a harmonious ecological environment and ecological system between man and nature. The plan calls for a rise in forest coverage from 8.6 to 12 percent, and an increase in the per capita area of park greenery from 10 square meters to 15 square meters.The plan has been guided by the Ministry of Natural Resources and jointly developed by Shanghai municipality, East China’s Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It took more than three years from its launch in July 2019 to its approval by the State Council in February 2023.Global Times
