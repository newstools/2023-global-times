Those who still need to drive in Macao after 14 days just need to register at Macao's Public Security Police Force to  receive a one-year-long permit.The recognition of the two regions' driving license will directly benefit those moving across the border for travel or family visit and is very significant for further promoting the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, said an officialfrom the Ministry of Public Security.In 2004, eligible residents were able change their mainland driving license into the Hong Kong equivalent without testing and vice versa.As the mainland and Hong Kong SAR have recognized each other's driving license, the Ministry of Public Security will continue to work with transportation management departments in Hong Kong and Macao to make it more convenient for people to drive within the three regions, the official said.
