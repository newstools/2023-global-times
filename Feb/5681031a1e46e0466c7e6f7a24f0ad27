The GOP-controlled House is now pushing further military aid to the island of Taiwan with its "power of the purse," Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.The Republicans' letter aims to push Biden to be more aggressive on the Taiwan question and Biden's prudence on the question may incur strong criticism from the GOP. This may lead to more irrational handling of the Taiwan question and less room for change, Li said.Aside from imposing pressure on Biden, the Republicans also want the letter to incite an atmosphere of support for the island of Taiwan and to use public opinion against the Democrats, said Li.The Republicans are exerting efforts in taking over the steering wheel from the White House and the provocation will affect China-US relations, analysts said.The Taiwan question is an important issue within China-US relations. However, the US' current policy is split. The White House has its strategy while Congress seems to adopt another, resulting in mixed signals from the US, said Li. The US should practice prudence whether in arms sales or official exchanges with the island, as its actions could further strain bilateral relations, Li noted.
