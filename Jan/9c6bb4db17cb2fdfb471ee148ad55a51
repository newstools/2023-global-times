French baguettes are seen at a bakery shop in Paris, France, Nov. 30, 2022. Artisanal know-how and culture of baguette bread was officially inscribed on the list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on Wednesday.(Photo: Xinhua)Recently described as "250 grams of magic and perfection" by French President Emmanuel Macron, the French baguette is at risk from surging energy prices, with some bakers warning they can no longer afford to fire up their ovens.Already struggling with sharp hikes in the price of butter, flour and sugar over the last year and a half, the prized industry is now alarmed by astronomical electricity bills looming in 2023. "It was absolutely inconceivable to me that a power bill could make me close my shop and stop my life here," said Julien Bernard-Regnard, a distraught baker in the village of Bourgaltroff in eastern France.He is still coming to terms with closing his doors for the final time in early December 2022 having decided that continuing his business, built up over the last five years, was impossible given the cost of electricity."I had to renew my contract at the beginning of September and it increased by three and half times," he said.His monthly power costs rose from around 400 euros ($420) a month to nearly 1,500, while shopping around for an alternative supplier brought no relief. "I'm in lots of online groups with other bakers and on social media. There are bakeries closing every day. Some have bills that are multiplied by 10 or 12." In a country where the availability of crusty daily bread is a political issue fraught with danger for any government, Macron's cabinet is keen to show it is doing everything possible to safeguard the nation's 35,000 bread and croissant makers.Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne previously announced that bakers with a cash flow problem could ask to delay the payment of their taxes and social charges, while Economy Minister Bruno le Maire welcomed the national bakers' federation for talks at his offices.Although France has capped electricity prices for consumers, limiting rises to 4 percent in 2022 and 15 percent in 2023, no such protection exists for businesses.AFP
