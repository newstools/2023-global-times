At the conference, which mapped policy priorities for 2023, the country vowed to support platform enterprises in leading development, job creation and international competition in a big way."The development and recovery of the economy cannot be achieved without the platforms, which provide services to Chinese consumers and directly or indirectly provide jobs to tens of millions of people," Liu said.Global Times
