He warned that China could try to "dominate" the locations it reaches on the lunar surface or even try to "keep the US out." China displayed a model of the country's own new-generation manned launch vehicle at the 14th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in November 2022.The CASC revealed in a statement it provided to the Global Times that the new-generation manned rocket was designed and developed in accordance with Chinese manned space authorities’ overall plan.Currently, developers are concluding the research stage with newly achieved technological breakthroughs and the rocket is moving into a prototype development stage, according to the CASC.It will be a three and a half stages launcher that stretches 90 meters in height, 5 meters in diameter and weighs some 2,187 tons at launch. Possessing a launch thrust of 2,678 kilonewtons and two 5-meter-diameter boosters, it is capable of sending a payload of 27 tons directly to the Lunar Transfer Orbit (LTO), or a payload of 70 tons to the near-Earth orbit, per the CASC."It will be the key strategic support in the country's development into a space power. It is expected to reach maiden flight conditions by 2027," the CASC said.Having delivered a record-breaking 50-plus orbital launches in 2022, the CASC – the main contractor for China’s aerospace projects – revealed in early January that it had also scheduled more than 50 aerospace launches in 2023.The CASC will also push forward the research and development work for the country’s fourth-phase lunar exploration and asteroid probe programs, which include the Chang’e-7 and Tianwen-2 missions. It is expected that the Long March-6C launcher will also have its maiden flight in 2023, the CASC disclosed.
