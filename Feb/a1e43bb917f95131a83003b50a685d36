According to a national study of juveniles' internet use in 2021, 47.6 percent of underage netizens frequently watch short videos on different platforms, as reported by guancha.cn.Although most of the short video platforms have set up the mode specially for minors, which can remind and guide users to take the initiative to use it through system pop-ups and other ways since March 2019 when the system was launched by the Cyberspace Administration of China, it is not difficult for children in practice to bypass the platform's special model by using elder identity information. A survey on the issue found that more than 70 percent of juvenile internet users believe it is necessary for video platforms to have a system for minors.Experts in the field of education have also highlighted the issue of short videos' influence on youth. Xiong Bingqi, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, called for policies and regulations from the government, as well as increased supervision and guidance from parents.
