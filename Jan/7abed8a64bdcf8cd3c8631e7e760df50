Chinese tech firms including TCL, Hisense, Lenovo and electric carmaker BYD actively displayed their latest technologies and products at the show.Chinese leading consumer electronics brand TCL booked a 1,600 square meter booth in the Central Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center, where visitors will see its exhibits, including an ultra large-screen Mini LED QLED TV line-up and other advanced electronic products.This year, exhibits related to electric vehicles, autonomous driving and the Internet of Things are attractive to visitors.China's leading new-energy vehicle maker BYD told the Global Times on Thursday that it is working with US chipmaker NVIDIA to bring NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud game streaming to its vehicles.Â BYD demonstrated how technological innovation is enhancing the automotive smart cockpit and bringing users an immersive gaming experience during NVIDIA's CES 2023 special address.RoboSense, a Shenzhen-based provider of Smart LiDAR Sensor Systems, will debut its first solid-state, short-range flash LiDAR, RS-LiDAR-E1, at the CES. The company said that the LiDar will be mass produced in the second half of 2023.Against the backdrop of anti-globalization sentiment and growing geopolitical tensions, Chinese companies actively participated in the event, after the optimization of anti-COVID measures in the country reflected the strong willingness of Chinese and US companies to ramp up cooperation, according to an industry expert.Despite the US technological "decoupling" push, more and more Chinese companies showcased their cutting-edge technologies at the CES, showing that Chinese companies have become an important force in the global technological arena, Liu Dingding, a veteran analyst and close observer of the internet industry, told the Global Times on Thursday."Cooperation between Chinese and American tech firms is still the major trend, given the attractiveness of China's vast market as well as rich application scenarios for new technologies," he said, citing the success of Tesla and Apple in the Chinese market.In addition, US technology shares dropped heavily in 2022, and it's urgent for the Biden administration to boost industry morale by promoting bilateral cooperation to make the cake bigger in the market, according to Liu.
