The Chinese government has sent rescue teams to earthquake-jolted Turkey and Syria and provided a combined 70 million yuan ($10.3 million) emergency aid to the two countries.

Their output is providing guaranteed power supplies for quake relief, according to the company.To meet Turkey's booming power demand and economic transition, the company has built nine projects in the hydropower sector over the years while actively seeking local cooperation in green energy such as wind and solar power."We will further track the comprehensive development plan for the disaster area drafted by the Turkish government, and we are willing to participate in the reconstruction of infrastructure, energy and power facilities, while helping people in the area resume production and normal life as soon as possible and rebuild their homes," PowerChina said.Henan D.R. Construction Group told the Global Times on Tuesday that it is willing to participate in the future rebuilding of both Turkey and Syria.The company is engaged in housing and highways construction, and it can help with the restoration of water supply and the drainage network, according to the company.Heavy equipment maker SANY Group said that it has been providing and coordinating equipment needed for rescue work at the epicenter. It is also ready to be part of the region's rebuilding, where its excavators, cranes and concrete equipment can be used for those who need these items the most, the Global Times learned.In a recent announcement, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the government's target was to rebuild "in one year," according to media reports.However, the rebuilding, a major task due to the massive destruction, could take much longer, some media reports speculated, especially given the potential cost.  Bank of America estimates that rebuilding costs in Turkey could be between $3 billion and $5 billion, or possibly more, Bloomberg reported.Zhang Xiang, a director of the China International Contractors Association, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Chinese companies have the advantages including in terms of capital and technology.But whether there will be a need for foreign companies, including those from China, has yet to be decided.It's still unclear how such issues will be decided, a person close to the Turkish government told the Global Times on Tuesday."Turkey has the second-biggest construction infrastructure in the world after China… therefore I don't think Chinese companies would get any benefit. But as I said, it's not very clear yet," the person said.Chinese companies' active participation in regional cooperation, particularly in infrastructure, is a common scene worldwide under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has played an increasingly important role in injecting new impetus into economic and social development.In January, China and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation under the BRI, providing strong support for Chinese companies to participate in the reconstruction process of Syria, the country devastated by war for years."We welcome Chinese companies to invest in Syria and participate in our economic reconstruction," Syrian Ambassador to China Muhammad Hassanein Khalil Khaddam told the media in January.
