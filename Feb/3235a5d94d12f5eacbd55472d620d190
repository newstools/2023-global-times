It was the largest sports event held in the global financial center since the city lifted COVID-19 restrictions. A total of 37,000 people, including celebrities such as Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat, participated in the competition.Many Chinese internet users were glad to read the news. "I'm happy that Hong Kong is returning to what it used to be before the pandemic. For Hong Kong, a major financial hub, holding of such event will inject confidence and vigor in the city," one said.Sina WeiboA young man from Central China's Henan Province, who is engaged in the financial industry, took one and a half years and spent about 1 million yuan (about $147,000) to build an actual plane. He used his computer knowledge to handle the digital drawing, modeling, 3D printing and assembly of the plane step by step. Some netizens found this astonishing, saying that it was great to have a dream and even greater to insist on realizing that dream. But others thought such a move was no different from buying a luxury sports car and had nothing to do with realizing his dreams as he spent so much money on it and didn't invent a new thing. Commentator Cang Nan YanTwenty years ago, a grandmother from Central China's Hunan Province opened a barber shop that charges 3 yuan (44 cents) a haircut, and since then has not raised prices. A video clip shared by the China News Service on Weibo shows that whenever she has customers who are the elderly or impoverished, she often offers them discounts or gives the haircut free of charge. The elderly woman said that she does so because other people helped her daughter when she was sick at a very young age. She is paying back society within her own abilities, and has always kept a grateful heart.Qingdao Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League via Weibo
