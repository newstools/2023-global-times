Illustration: Xia Qing/GTRecently, a woman surnamed Liu accidentally dropped her phone into a canyon about 700 meters deep while playing in a scenic spot in Xianning City, Hubei Province. After calling the 24-hour help service hotline, the scenic spot mobilized pumping machines and generators to salvage the phone for eight hours and finally found it. There are skeptical voices that say this is a waste of public resources. The scenic spot, in turn, responded that it is located in a key area of water conservation and the soaked phone may lead to water pollution. What's more, it is a worthwhile spot to satisfy tourists. From calming the emotions of tourists to salvaging the phone, this scenic spot always shows "tourists first," treating every tourist with a sincere and meticulous attitude, and serving the demands of tourists to the greatest extent without harming the interests of others. For the scenic area, pumping water for eight hours to find a mobile phone may be a small matter. But it's the little things that move people's hearts and attract more visitors. Hopefully, such "scenic spot advertising" can be more, to give tourists a better travel experience but also to boost the recovery of epidemic-hit tourism.
