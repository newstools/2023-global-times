He said that in a few days, it will be the Spring Festival, which is a traditional Chinese gala. "It gives me great pleasure to gather with you to welcome Spring Festival, to talk about friendship and to discuss state affairs."Xi pointed out that 2022 was extremely important in the history of the Party and the country, and it also marked the 100th anniversary of the Party's release of its united front policy. All non-CPC parties have carried out education about political handover on the theme of "unswervingly following the Party and joining hands to forge ahead into the new era." They have kept in mind the original intention of cooperation and carried forward fine traditions, and our ideological and political consensus has been consolidated. The central committees of all these political parties and personages without party affiliation have conducted in-depth investigations and carried out democratic supervision on major issues in reform, development and stability. What they have done has provided important references for the CPC Central Committee to make decisions and policies, and effectively implement them. The ACFIC has promoted the "Ten Thousand Enterprises Helping Ten Thousand Villages" campaign to guide private enterprises to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and achieve high-quality development. He expressed heartfelt thanks to all on behalf of the CPC Central Committee.Xi stressed that upholding the leadership of the CPC and always working with the CPC in solidarity are the fundamental political foundation for multiparty cooperation.Xi said that the primary political responsibility of the new central leaderships of the non-CPC parties is to carry on the political legacy, deepen political consensus, and always maintain the political essence of pursuing the common goal with unity in thought and action and working together with the CPC.Xi hoped that they will make studying and implementing the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress an important part of deepening the political transition, strengthen theoretical and political guidance, and guide the members of their parties and the people they have close ties with to boost their commitment to the Four Consciousnesses, the Four-sphere Confidence, and the Two Upholds, so that their thoughts and actions will conform to the major decisions and arrangements made at the 20th CPC National Congress.It is imperative to consolidate and expand the achievements made in learning and education on the history of the CPC, launch a new round of themed education activities at an appropriate time, and continue to strengthen political, ideological, theoretical and emotional identification with the leadership of the CPC and socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said.Xi pointed out that it requires concerted efforts from the whole country to accomplish the central task of building China into a strong modern socialist country in all respects and promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. He hoped that the non-CPC parties will combine the strengths of multi-party cooperation with what the central task of the CPC Central Committee and overall development requires, pool their wisdom in participation in the deliberation and administration of state affairs, put forward forthright admonitions in democratic supervision, offer good advices in political consultation, and be a good advisor, a good helper and a good colleague of the CPC. They need to focus on major issues such as creating new development pattern, materializing the principle that the public sector must be unswervingly consolidated and developed, and the development of the non-public sector must be unswervingly encouraged, supported, and guided, making solid progress in promoting common prosperity, and carry out in-depth investigations and actively offer advices, Xi said. They need to diversify forms, expand channels, and constantly improve the pertinence and effectiveness of democratic supervision. They should guide their members and the people they have close ties with to strengthen their confidence, enhance their fighting spirit so that they will have the courage to overcome difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead. The ACFIC should promote the implementation of relief policies for enterprises, help private enterprises overcome specific difficulties, and boost the confidence of private sector in economic development.Xi stressed that, to give full play to the political strengths of China's new type of political party system, the non-CPC parties should further improve themselves, and take steps to make them more capable of staying on top of the overall political situation, participating in the deliberation and administration of state affairs, improving their leadership, cooperating with other parties and solving their own problems. He hoped that they inherit the fine traditions of multi-party cooperation, namely, being of one heart and mind with the CPC, loving the country and serving the people, working closely together and dedicating themselves to the common cause, so as to become parties participating in building socialism with Chinese characteristics with firm political stand, solid organization, effective performance of duties, excellent conduct and sound institutions. They should intensify their efforts to consolidate leaderships, embrace solidarity and coordination, and give full play to the overall functions of leaderships, so as to build a good image featuring pragmatism, enterprise and integrity. As this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ACFIC, Xi called for efforts to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the federation, adhere to reform and innovation, and advance education and guidance of the prominent members, so that the federation can better play its role as an assistant to the CPC and a bridge between business circle and the CPC.Shi Taifeng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the committee's United Front Work Department, Chen Xi, head of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, heads of the central committees of other political parties and the ACFIC, and leading officials of relevant central authorities took part in the activity.
