Sailing at 25 knots, its standard range can reach 280 nautical miles. The ship drone can adapt to sea state 4, and can operate fully autonomously, semi-autonomously, through remote control or manually, its maker said.The drone can be equipped with optical and electronic sensors, radar systems, guns and missile launchers, and it can be deployed for alert patrols, as well as reconnaissance and precision strike missions around islands, reefs and maritime borders as an armed reconnaissance ship drone. It can also provide fire support to naval forces by blocking small to medium-sized maritime targets from approaching. With technological breakthroughs in communications, sensors, target identification and image processing, China has made huge strides in the field of unmanned vessels. Their comprehensive development could lift revolutions in naval warfare to a new era, observers said. Unmanned vessels have already been deployed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict by both sides.At the IDEX, a remote control station is available for visitors to experience operating an unmanned vessel thousands of kilometers away in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province. The drone ship can take commands in real time, autonomously pick routes and carry out missions, showing that China has achieved beyond-visual-range control of unmanned vessels, the press release said.China has also overcome the difficulties of swarm coordination among ship drones, with a company displaying swarm coordination between 56 unmanned boats in 2018, and six unmanned fast boats intercepting and expelling a mock target in coordination in 2022, media reports showed.The hardware on display shows China's high level of confidence in its technologies, as the remote-control technology, extended range and swarm technology give more tactical depth to unmanned vessels, an industry insider who requested anonymity told the Global Times.Compared with large warships, unmanned boats reduce costs and avoid casualties, making them a trend in future naval warfare, the insider said.The unmanned boats displayed at the IDEX are available for export, the Global Times learned.
