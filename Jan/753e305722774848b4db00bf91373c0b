It mustn't have been easy for him but it worked out," she added.The Binche carnival's cancelation in 2021 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic was a "black hole" for the business, Kersten said, adding "we couldn't even imagine a future for the carnival."It was the first time the carnival was canceled since World War II, significantly reducing costume makers' income from renting out their pieces."Now [the return of the carnival] is a great relief. Still, every morning we look at the COVID numbers," Kersten said.Her ostrich feather hat weighs 4 kilograms and maintaining it takes 85 hours a year. The costume itself requires 13 hours of work. Kersten said the family can make 300 costumes per year.Reuters
