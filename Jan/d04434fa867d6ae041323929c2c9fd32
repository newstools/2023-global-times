The guided-missile destroyers Hohhot (Hull 161) and Wuhan (Hull 169), together with the guided-missile frigate Hengyang (Hull 568), steam in formation in an undisclosed sea area during a 4-day maritime real-combat training exercise on September 2, 2020. All the warships are attached to a naval destroyer flotilla under the PLA Southern Theater Command.

Later, when the warship goes further and goes solo, it could make port calls in friendly countries for replenishment, or receive supplies from friendly commercial ships in the vicinity," Wei said.On December 22, 2022, the French Pacific Command said in a social media post that a Chinese destroyer was transiting near the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia in the South Pacific. The news website of the US Naval Institute identified the destroyer as the Yinchuan based on its hull number 175.The linear distance between French Polynesia and the Chinese mainland is well beyond 10,000 kilometers, and since the Yinchuan couldn't have sailed in a straight line and may have sailed even further and eventually needed to return, the voyage would indeed have covered more than 10,000 nautical miles, observers said.The PLA Navy is sailing increasingly deeper into the far sea for patrols and exercises, and its capabilities to safeguard China's strategic interests and carry out missions are also growing, Wei said.
