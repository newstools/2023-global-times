In 2018, the ruins within Diaoyu city were listed among China's top 10 archaeological discoveries."One of the reasons for Diaoyu city being granted this honor is that we excavated the earliest remains of a bomb found in China, and even in the world," Yuan said.During the tour, Yuan also explained how the city wall was found inside a lush forest on the steep mountainside, how its history was pieced together from a stone tablet buried in moss, and how two tiny brass chess pieces were found at the bottom of a big pond."Archaeology is like embroidery because they both need subtlety and patience. Any stone, shard, even one sentence in the book, could be the crucial element for us to tie together the history," he said.After the explanation, a 12-year-old boy named Liang Ruiqian asked about the most precious thing excavated by Yuan, who started Diaoyu city's archeological excavation 20 years ago."In fact, the whole structure and layout of Diaoyu city is the most valuable thing, instead of some single artifact," answered Yuan. "We often attach importance to movable cultural relics, while the immovable ones are of the same importance."Yuan said it is amazing that ancient people built such a fully functional military base without modern technology. Their sense of space still intrigues archaeologists.Official data show that Chongqing has about 26,000 immovable cultural relics and over 1.48 million movable ones. By the end of 2021, there were 108 million pieces (sets) of state-owned movable cultural relics, and about 767,000 immovable ones. The total number of world heritage sites in China has reached 56, ranking second in the world.Other than the study tour, Chongqing has made other efforts to promote the charm of history and culture, such as opening the country's first archaeology-themed cafe and launching an immersive experience in a historic structure.Xinhua
