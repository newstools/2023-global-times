In addition, Saudi Arabia has also reportedly deployed the China-made Silent Hunter anti-drone laser system.China is exhibiting more drones and anti-drone systems at the ongoing IDEX, including a new anti-drone laser system called the Sky Shield, China Central Television reported on Wednesday.Attractive Chinese products also include the VU-4 unmanned ground combat vehicle and AR3 modularized long-range rocket system from NORINCO.Weapons and equipment in these categories have gained public attention, as they were deployed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, observers said.The deal for the L15 trainer jet with the UAE could just be the beginning, and Arab countries could further enhance defense cooperation with China and procure more Chinese defense products in order to balance US hegemonic influences, analysts said.
