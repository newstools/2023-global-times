This is 1.83 per thousand higher than the national rate of 6.77 per thousand.Compared to 2021, the number of new births was 10,900 fewer, and the birth rate decreased by 1.14 per thousand year-on-year, a drop that was 0.52 per thousand points higher than the previous year.At least two reasons result in population declines in a region, said experts. The first one is that the natural population growth rate is negative, that is, the birth rate is lower than the death rate. The second is that as the outflow of population is greater than the inflow, the migration of a population is negative, experts noted.Several provinces and regions, including Jiangxi in East China, Guangxi in South China, Guizhou in Southwest China, Gansu and Qinghai in Northwest China, Chongqing in Southwest China, and Anhui in Central China, have released their population data for 2022, all of which have shown positive growth in terms of permanent population.Notably, the permanent populations of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Guangxi increased by 140,000, 105,800, and 100,000 respectively.However, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China showed that the overall population of the Chinese mainland experienced negative growth in 2022 for the first time in 61 years, decreasing by 850,000.Observers believe that negative population growth is the inevitable result of the country's long-term low fertility rate, but they also note that the country's demographic dividend will not disappear, contrary to some pessimistic claims.Global Times
