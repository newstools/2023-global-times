As film director Guo Fan previously wrote in an article published in People's Daily, "Only a strong country can support a strong science fiction industry."Whether it is to one day realize the movie's vision of propelling the Earth out of the Solar System toward another habitable star system or to work on the construction of heavy industry, China's leading enterprises in this field have always been working together.CASIC expressed its willingness to cooperate under CNNC's post. "Are we not supposed to do this together?" CASIC asked.Meanwhile, China Unicom and China Telecom have offered to shoulder the burden of communication.The interaction between these leading enterprises also aroused the enthusiasm of netizens. "What kind of dream linkage is this?" one netizen wrote on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo.Another netizen from Shanghai wrote that indeed The Wandering Earth II gives us a glimpse of China's future technological development through sci-fi films, and there is no doubt that the contribution of these enterprises is incalculable.It's also worth noting that these enterprises are all sanctioned by the US, which aims to stop China's technological development due to fears that China might achieve what happens in the movie, the netizen added.
