For thousands of years, letters, across mountains and oceans, have been delivering writers' sentiments and conveying friendship and expectations.Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese president, has managed to find time to reply to some letters from different parts of society and the world despite his busy work schedule.Through his letters, Xi has corresponded with international friends from all walks of life on numerous occasions, part of a series of excellent stories of China's international exchanges in the new era. The letters have also added vivid color to the diplomacy between China and other countries.The Global Times traced and contacted some of the recipients of Xi's letters, to hear the inspiring stories behind the letters and their communication with the president.In this installment, we talked to one of the Greek scholars who received Xi's reply letter over the founding of an institute dedicated to mutual learning between China and Greece.What spark could the two ancient civilizations of China and Greece have in common? What essence does the vision of building a human community with a shared future draw from the communication of the two ancient civilizations?A recent letter exchange reminded people about the commonality of the two ancient civilizations of China and Greece - harmonious coexistence, which provides important spiritual guidance for mankind to solve the problems of the times.Chinese President Xi Jinping has replied to a letter from Professor Stelios Virvidakis of the University of Athens and four other Greek scholars recently, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations, the Xinhua News Agency reported on February 21.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.A few days ago, five Greek scholars, including Professor Virvidakis, wrote a joint letter to Xi, in which they expressed in great length their high recognition of the concept of civilization advocated by Xi and introduced preparations and development plans of the center.The Greek scholars were impressed by Xi's great attention to the exchanges between the civilizations, which shows China's open and inclusive attitude toward different cultures.During Xi's state visit to Greece in 2019, he and the Greek leaders jointly advocated exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations. After the visit, the two sides actively implemented the consensus of the leaders and made preparations for the establishment of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations, according to Xinhua.The center was launched on February 20 at the University of Athens.Now, it is of great historical and contemporary significance for the two countries to establish the center, which is committed to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations of various countries, said Xi in the letter.Xi said he believes that the center will certainly make a great contribution in this regard."We had access to certain texts written by President Xi and we knew that he is really interested in the promotion of the study of ancient civilizations (especially history and archaeology). Moreover, when he visited Greece a few years ago he expressed his respect and admiration for Greek culture. So we decided to write and send him a letter," Virvidakis recalled to the Global Times on February 14.Virvidakis said that they wanted to draw President Xi's attention to the fact that a center with similar goals and an analogous structure was going to be created in China Southwest University, in their hope to get more support from Xi."We share the president's conviction that the legacy of both Greek and Chinese civilizations, which, during their long history, have influenced many other cultures in Europe, Asia, and in the rest of the world, and can once more provide spiritual guidance, helping us deal with the serious problems humanity is facing in an era of modernization. We trust that he is going to be on our side as we try to pursue our ambitious projects," Virvidakis told the Global TimesXi also stressed in the letter that in the long course of human history, various nations have created civilizations with their own characteristics and symbols, which jointly form a colorful garden of human civilization.Civilizations are the rich accumulation of the historical exploration and also an underlying guide to the survival and development of the nations, he said.In order to promote the development of human society and jointly build a global community of shared future, we must deeply understand and grasp the age-old origins and rich contents of different civilizations and let the essence of all civilizations benefit the present generation and all mankind, Xi said in the letter.Xi pointed out that people can know the present by making references to the past and they often carry forward the undertakings of the predecessors to open up a new path for the future.Virvidakis suggested that in both Chinese and Greek philosophy, there was not just a theoretical enterprise aiming at knowledge, but a comprehensive way of life guiding people's behavior. "Drawing on these common elements we could aspire to reinvigorate contemporary philosophy, which has become too technical and scholastic and perhaps propose humanistic values for what President Xi describes as a 'community with a shared future' that could serve as a kind of cultural model for mankind as a whole."History has amply proven that human civilization can continue to thrive and prosper by sticking to inclusiveness and openness, the Chinese president said.The world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, Xi said, adding that to solve outstanding contradictions and problems facing the mankind, it is necessary to rely on material means to overcome difficulties and rely on the strength of the spirit to rectify mind through thinking with sincerity.Virvidakis said they felt "particularly honored, moved, and happy to receive Xi's congratulatory letter which showed that he recognized the importance of the values we wanted to promote.""We know how busy President Xi is and we couldn't be sure that he would find the time to send us a reply," he noted.Virvidakis revealed that the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations will involve rich exchange programs in the near future. For example, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens will lead the way in exchanges that will allow mutual academic visits of Chinese and Greek scholars.Moreover, Aristotle University of Thessaliniki, the biggest University in Northern Greece, will organize a big conference on issues related to the study of the two philosophical traditions, as well as a series of lectures on the reception of Chinese thought in Europe in the modern era, to further build a cultural bridge.Virvidakis told the Global Times that they intend to attract young people to participate in activities initiated by the center, and the friendship between China and Greek would be the basis for mutual understanding and further collaboration."They could thus serve as a cultural bridge between the two nations. I have traveled to many places in China and have been impressed not only by the intelligence and the quality of education received by most students, but also by their enthusiasm to know more about the Greek tradition which they admire. There should be more and more exchanges and visits by members of the younger generations in the two countries," he suggested.
