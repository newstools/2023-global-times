According to Taiwan media outlets, a Taiwan businessman based in Tianjin said that in the past three years under the shadow of the epidemic, Taiwan businessmen have continued to increase investment in the mainland. However, the "New Southbound Policy" promoted by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has completely failed, which shows that the mainland is still regarded as a better place for Taiwan businessmen to invest.Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press briefing on Monday that the mainland is willing to strengthen exchanges with the KMT, consolidate and enhance mutual trust, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields on the common political foundation of adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence."Joint efforts should be made to advance relations between the Communist Party of China and the KMT and relations across the Taiwan Straits, safeguard peace and stability across the Straits, and improve the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the Straits, Zhu noted. Analysts said that by visiting the mainland, the KMT hopes to send a message to Taiwan society that the DPP can't ease cross-Straits tensions, but the KMT can. They believed that the resumption and expansion of cross-Straits exchanges seems to be the inevitable trend in the post-COVID-19 era, even in the face of the DPP authorities' obstruction.Global Times
