In 2022, the National Peking Opera Company introduced its first AI humanoid opera performer You Zixi. The AI figure learned her moves from other Peking Opera performers.As the concept of metaverse has jumped from sci-fi novels to the small screens and now into real life art, this unstoppable trend also has insiders worried: Has art really entered a digital realm and where do the boundaries lie?Liang Xin, a theater industry insider and Henan Opera performer, told the Global Times on Sunday that no matter what kind of high technology enters the industry, the ultimate goal is to make per-formances better."The use of high-technology, such as the metaverse, in any aspect, should be used to make audi-ences feel the beauty of art, the operas or plays, so to speak. We cannot lose the essence of art by focusing too much on technology. I believe that's what the metaverse theater festival will also fo-cus on," said Liang.
