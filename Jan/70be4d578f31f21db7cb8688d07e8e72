"The Liaoning recently conducted drills in the West Pacific, and now the Shandong is practicing in the South China Sea. In the future, the two carriers might form a dual carrier group and train together," he said.On Thursday, the US Navy announced that its Nimitz carrier strike group began operating in the South China Sea, with two Chinese ships tailing, CNN reported on the day.Attempting to threaten China, the US aircraft carrier's activities in the South China Sea actually have limited military significance and will only stir up tension in the region, experts said.A recent war game scenario run by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies indicated that the US would lose its aircraft carriers should they interfere in a possible conflict in the Taiwan Straits.It is normal that the PLA monitors potentially provocative foreign military moves on China's doorstep, and the foreign forces would serve as practice partners that contribute to the PLA's combat readiness, analysts said.In December, a US RC-135 spy plane engaged in dangerous maneuvers against a PLA Navy J-11 fighter jet that was monitoring the US aircraft during the latter's close-in reconnaissance of China over the South China Sea.Â The Chinese pilot took professional and standard action according to laws and regulations, fully reflecting the Chinese military's responsible attitude toward regional safety and the safety of frontline personnel, said Senior Colonel Tian Junli, a spokesperson of the PLA Southern Theater Command.
