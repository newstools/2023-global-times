Citing the very low military expenditure when China had to focus on economic development before the 2000s, he said that China is only picking up what has been left.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that China's defense budget growth rate for 2023 could be higher than that of 2022.Over the past year, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to a severe deterioration in the global security situation. Around China, then US house speaker Nancy Pelosi provocatively visited China's Taiwan region in August 2022, the US frequently hyped a potential conflict between China and the US, and Japan has broken away from its defense-only principle and has started procuring offensive missiles that could reach China.Under such an unfavorable situation, China needs to enhance its armed forces' combat readiness, including boosting the procurement of new weapons and equipment, intensifying realistic combat-oriented exercises, and improving troop welfare, which all require extra funding, Song said.Overcoming headwinds including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, China's GDP expanded by 3 percent year-on-year in 2022, and buoyed by the country's optimized epidemic response and effective pro-growth policies, some economists predicted China's GDP may post a strong 6 percent year-on-year growth at most in 2023.This will lay a solid foundation for a possible defense budget growth, experts said.

China's defense budget in 2022 Graphic: Deng Zijun/GTGlobal expenditure hikesThe latest US National Defense Authorization Act signed in December 2022 authorized $817 billion in spending for the Pentagon for fiscal year 2023, CNN reported at the time.This means that US military expenditure remains three to four times that of China, retaining its position as the top of the world by far, at a time when some US officials and military leaders have been hyping a potential military conflict with China.Japan in December 2022 approved a record-high 6.8 trillion yen ($51 billion) draft defense budget for fiscal 2023, marking a whopping 26.3 percent increase from 2022, after pledging to acquire capabilities to strike other countries in a major policy shift under the country's war-renouncing constitution, Kyodo News reported at the time.Some other countries like India, the UK, France, Germany and Australia are all planning to increase their defense spending, according to media reports.Over the past few years, China's military spending has been kept at about 1.3 percent of GDP, while the figure for the US is about 3.5 percent, and the NATO guideline is 2 percent.If China joins the global trend of defense spending hikes, it should not be considered as participating in an arms race, as China's military expenditure accounts for only a small proportion of its GDP, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times.Considering the world average, China has room to further raise its defense budget to meet the corresponding status as a major country in the world, the expert said.China follows a national defense strategy that is defensive in nature, which means that its military spending is used to safeguard the country's national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests, rather than to violate others and build up hegemony like the US, the expert said.A strong Chinese military is a positive asset to the world, analysts said. In terms of the traditional security field, it brings balance and constitutes a stable factor, and in terms of the non-traditional security field, it actively provides international public security goods like far sea escorts, peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, they said.
