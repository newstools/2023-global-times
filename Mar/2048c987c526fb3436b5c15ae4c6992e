But we don't see the policy as an isolated case, and we believe it will be followed by a policy that allows international cruise ships to use Shanghai as a home port for operations not far down the road," Liu said, adding that it would mean the restart of China's international cruise business after a halt of three years.However, Liu noted that global cruise operators need time to readjust on a whole range of issues from logistics to sales, so it may take months before the first international cruise ship docks at Shanghai.On the one hand, some destinations are not yet covered in China's pilot program for outbound group tours. On the other hand, it takes time to adjust international routes, a customer service employee at MSC Cruise told the Global Times on Tuesday."Cruise ships are typically deployed a year in advance so we expect the earliest possible routes to restart by next year," she said Before the pandemic, China was the second-largest cruise market. According a report released by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, the contribution of international cruise travel to China's economy was 35.8 billion yuan ($5.20 billion) in 2019. By 2035, China's cruise market will reach 14 million passengers per year, making it the world's largest cruise market, according to a guideline issued by the Ministry of Transport and National Development and Reform Commission.
