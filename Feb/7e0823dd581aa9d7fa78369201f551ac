Ya Ya is suffering, Ya Ya wants to go home."In April of 2003, Ya Ya from Beijing Zoo and Le Le from Shanghai Zoo arrived at the Memphis Zoo in the US state of Tennessee as a part of a joint conservation and research project between the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens and the US zoo with an agreement duration of 10 years which was extended by 10 more years in 2013. Earlier in February, giant panda Le Le, Ya Ya's male partner, died at the zoo at the age of 25, triggering global outcry over the suspected lack of proper care for the giant pandas in the zoo.China and the US are actively coordinating and handling relevant procedures to try to bring Ya Ya back to China at an early date. China has issued import licenses and quarantine permits, identified quarantine sites and made relevant preparations for the return of Ya Ya.
