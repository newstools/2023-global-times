And, the nation's development in memory microchips that are critical to storage systems remain a weak link, Feng said.Moving forward, deputies and members have come up with detailed proposals which highlight the need for strengthened efforts to resolve industry wide bottlenecks. The proposal by aviation industry deputies and members pointed out that the expansion of more application scenarios and system construction are two key directions for the future work, in a bid to accelerate the development of the industry, enhance Chinese firms' competitiveness, and create a Chinese paradigm for the development of strategic emerging industries.Feng said that her research team has jointly established a laboratory with a number of leading Chinese enterprises to develop the next-generation memory chips with faster speed and lower energy consumption.The Government Work Report delivered to NPC stressed that scientific and technological policies should aim at building up China's strength and self-reliance in science and technology throughout 2023.
