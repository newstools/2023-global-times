Many reputed universities in Russia, including Moscow State University, St. Petersburg University and Far Eastern Federal University, have set up Confucius Institutes to translate and study Chinese writers’ works, Zhang Hongbo, director-general of the China Written Works Copyright Society, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Wang Zhiliang's draft translation of Russian novel Eugene Onegin According to a report released by the National Press and Publication Administration, China exported the copyrights to 947 and 882 books to Russia in 2019 and 2020 respectively, making Russia the top destination for Chinese book copyrights for two consecutive years. (Official statistics for 2021 have not yet been released.)Zhang added that China’s traditional literature works, such as those from the school of Confucianism, have had a profound influence on Russia. In addition, literary and artistic works that reflect the economic and social development of contemporary China as well as science fiction works represented by Chinese writer Liu Cixin are very popular among Russian readers.Chinese contemporary dramas are another hit topic. The association is helping Russian sinologists select contemporary Chinese drama masterpieces. For example, Chinese Nobel Prize winner Mo Yan’s literature Frog will debut on the stage of Russian dramas in 2023.
