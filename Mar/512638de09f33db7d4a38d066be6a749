The region sustains the drinking water safety for more than 300 million people living in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and as the major supplementary water source for the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project, it also provided water for nearly half of the population across the country. Under the guidance of the Yangtze River Protection Law as well as other relevant policies, additional comprehensive scientific research targeted the Three Gorges Reservoir Region's ecological and economic and social environment would help fully understand the region's natural resources including lands, mineral products, waters, forestry and corresponding social and economic situations, according to Shi.Such research would also provide precise data support toward realizing the goals of sustainable and high-quality development of the region as well as innovation of China's hydraulic engineering, Shi said. Shi proposed that research on the Three Gorges Reservoir Region should include comprehensive application of remote sensing surveys, on-site investigation, field sampling and lab analysis, among others. The key of such research would be on spheres including the natural geographical environment, forest resources, land resources, biodiversity, water resources and water environment, ecological functions, social and human environment, ecological environment effects of reservoir operation, so as to form the natural geography of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region and a database mapping and tracking the environment and populated areas.Shi also proposed further analysis on the interaction and impact of reservoir regulation, human activities, climate changes and the region's water resources, lands, plant life, ecological diversity and social environment dynamics, so as to provide a base for the future optimization and policy work.  Global Times
