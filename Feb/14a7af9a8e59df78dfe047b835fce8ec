The partial remains of human bones were unearthed near a teaching building at the Wangjiang campus of Sichuan University in Chengdu while constructions of pipelines were being completed over the past few days, Jimu News reported on Monday. Speculation had been circulating on the internet that the remains may be related to a criminal case. However, Chengdu police who conducted an onsite inspection ruled out the possibility of a criminal element, according to Beijing News. According to campus security staff, local police have probed the scene and the bones have been confirmed as not belonging to a single complete skeleton and were buried before the 1970s. Campus security added that the location used to be the site of unmarked mass graves before the university was established. As of Monday evening, the pit at the corner of the building where the bones were discovered had been filled in, according to Jimu News. Global Times-Agencies
