Hong Kong File photoA senior Chinese official met top policy advisors from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Wednesday, expressing his hope for them to tell the story about the One Country, Two Systems principle well and let the whole world understand that the principle is a good system.Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met members of the 14th National Committee of the CPPCC from the HKSAR, bringing up three hopes for the members, including to properly implement the One Country, Two Systems, understand the Constitution and the Basic Law, further integrate into the country's development plan and seize opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.Wang also asked the members to pay attention to the livelihoods issues in the city, such as housing, employment, youth development and care for the elderly.Some experts and officials believe that as the anti-China rioting forces used to distort and smear the One Country, Two Systems, there has been a long-standing misunderstanding of the principle.It's important for the policy advisors from the HKSAR to introduce the true situation in Hong Kong and tell the stories about the One Country, Two Systems well, which will also help in the exploration of the Two Systems solution to the Taiwan question, some experts said.Hong Kong should play an active role in helping boosting the mainland's economy and social development and safeguarding the long-term prosperity of the HKSAR and Macao SAR. Senior Chinese leaders have pointed out the direction and the focus of Hong Kong's development, Peter Shiu Ka-fai, a member to the 14th National Committee of the CPPCC from the HKSAR, told the Global Times on Wednesday."I'll always remember those instructions from the top leadership as a reminder of my future work as CPPCC National Committee member and city legislator," he said.After HKSAR experienced the violent social turmoil in 2019, the central government helped push the city's transition from chaos to order with the national security law for Hong Kong and the electoral reform with the principle of only patriots governing Hong Kong. "The city should strive to develop its economy, setting a good example for our compatriots in Taiwan and showing that the One Country, Two Systems is working out," Shui said."Only when the foundation of One Country is more solid, the city under Two Systems will thrive, which will help advance the country's reunification," he said.The One Country, Two Systems has been distorted and slandered in the past few years by anti-China rioters and secessionist in Taiwan, colluded with the external interference of the US and its alllies, which caused a negative impact on Hong Kong youth generation who lacked recognition on the motherland, some experts said."Telling the story of One Country, Two Systems well is a part of the national security education, aiming to properly guide their understanding about the country and its political system," Tian Feilong, a legal expert at Beihang University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The One Country, Two Systems was originally brought up for the Taiwan question, which has been put into practice in Hong Kong and Macao SARs, and if the two cities could fully implement the principle well, it will help residents in Taiwan to better understand the practice, Tian said.National reunification by peaceful means is the first choice of the CPC and the Chinese government in resolving the Taiwan question, as it best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including our compatriots in Taiwan, and it works best for the long-term stability and development of China, according to a document entitled The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era released in August 2022.The One Country, Two Systems principle is an important institutional instrument created by the CPC and the Chinese government to enable peaceful reunification, the document said.
