To ensure production during the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on January 22 this year, Foxconn has introduced a salary incentive policy to encourage employees to stay put during the holidays. Workers can receive up to 13,000 yuan ($1,881) per month in subsidies. Li Junqiang, a logistics manager who's responsible for distribution and shipments at the Foxconn Zhengzhou plant, told Henan Daily that Foxconn's cargo logistics volume "reached the highest in nearly a year in the past two days, with 243 shipments for a single day."The speedy recovery comes after a staff shortage hit the Apple manufacturer amid a COVID flare-up in November. Production of iPhones could have slumped by as much as 30 percent at the plant in November, Reuters reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.Foxconn has since launched a mass recruitment campaign, offering incentives such as higher bonuses for new candidates and referrals.The Zhengzhou plant was known for producing the vast majority of high-end iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max devices.Since Foxconn set up operations in Zhengzhou in 2010, its cumulative imports and exports have accounted for about 60 percent of Henan's total trade and 80 percent of Zhengzhou's, official data showed.In the first three quarters of 2022, Henan's total trade reached 620.81 billion yuan, up 12.1 percent year-on-year. The export value of mobile phones was 186.48 billion yuan, accounting for 48.5 percent of the province's export value.
