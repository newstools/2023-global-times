Birth registration is mainly aimed to grant people with deserved rights and obligations.Rather than saying whether Sichuan's initiative will fundamentally reverse China's demographic trends featuring a low fertility rate and a fast-aging population, it is more likely that the Chinese society is moving toward a more inclusive population policy, Liu Hongyan, deputy director-general of China Population and Development Research Center, told the Global Times on Monday.Liu explained that the decline in the number of births in China is directly related to the decline in the number of women of childbearing age, a problem that is difficult to alleviate with policies.The main purpose of removing restrictions on marital status from birth registration is to better protect the health and reproductive rights of the people, especially those who have children without getting married, Liu added.Prior to Sichuan, other provinces have enacted similar measures or publicly solicited comments on similar policy adjustments.In May 2022, South China's Guangdong Province improved its birth registration system, emphasizing the neutrality and objectivity of birth registration as a working tool for population monitoring only. In Guangdong's regulations, people who are unmarried and have children can register new births. In June, the health commission of Northwest China's Shaanxi Province  clarified in its regulations on birth registration, saying that births out of wedlock can be registered. Central China's Anhui Province publicly sought public comment on a similar policy in August.The new birth registration measures in these provinces are seen as implementing the central government's request to improve the birth registration system in 2021.The population in the Chinese mainland fell for the first time in 61 years, decreasing by 850,000 in 2022, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) showed.Experts who track China's long-term population trends said that the decline is the inevitable result of the country's long-term fertility rate plus its impressive social and economic development."China's population peaked in 2022, much earlier than expected, which means that the population may fall further in 2023," said Cai Fang, former deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.China announced a third-child policy in May 2021 and rolled out a series of stimulus measures to boost population growth. A number of provinces and regions across the country have rolled out incentive policies such as issuing subsidies to families with a second or third child.
