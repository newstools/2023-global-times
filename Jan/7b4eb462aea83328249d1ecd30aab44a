The name is derived from an island in Trat province. The order was placed in September 2019, according to the report.The second landing platform dock was decommissioned in 2005, 43 years after the US Navy transferred it to the Thai government on August 31, 1962. The Thai Navy sank the second HTMS Chang at Hin Luk Bat diving site in Trat on November 28, 2012, as part of a project to recover marine resources there, read the report.The RTN has a 20-year strategy (2017-2036) to procure four landing platform docks to be used in operations such as amphibious warfare, marine rescue and disaster relief.The new HTMS Chang is 213 meters long and 28 meters at the beam. It has a maximum displacement of 20,003 tons and a top speed of 25 knots. The ship can tolerate choppy seas and can accommodate 600 officers. Built at a cost of 6.1 billion baht ($180 million), the ship will be commissioned by the Royal Thai Fleet in Chonburi province, The Nation reported.Developed by the No.708 Research Institute under China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and built by the Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai, the Type 071E landing platform dock completed its sea trial in early December 2022, CSSC announced at the time.As a 20,000 ton-class landing platform dock that is competitive on the global arms market, the Type 071E's transport capability and far sea maneuvering capability are among the best in the world, and its speed and endurance are considered superior to its foreign counterparts, reaching a world-leading level, CSSC said.The Type 071E is an export version of the Type 071 amphibious landing ship in service with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy with adjustments and customizations based on the needs of the Royal Thai Navy. Its large vehicle deck can support military vehicles including tanks and armored vehicles as well as mechanized and air-cushioned landing craft; its flight deck and hangar can host several helicopters for vertical landing missions, experts said.With the Type 071E, the Royal Thai Navy will not only get enhanced troop transport capability, but also improved disaster relief capability, according to experts.From January to February 2022, the PLA Navy sent the Type 071 amphibious dock landing ship Wuzhishan carrying more than 1,400 tons of supplies to Tonga, sailing more than 5,200 nautical miles to help the South Pacific country after a volcanic eruption triggered a tsunami.Global Times
