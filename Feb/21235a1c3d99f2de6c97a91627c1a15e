The defense authority on the island said it spotted four PLA aircraft and three PLA vessels around the island in the past 24 hours as of Monday morning.Should a conflict break out, a vulnerable P-8A aircraft is of little military significance on China's doorstep, but the PLA should remain wary of its close-in reconnaissance attempts in peacetime, the expert said,The US military has been frequently sending vessels and occasionally aircraft through the Taiwan Straits in the excuse of navigational rights and freedoms, but its real intention is to stir up trouble in the region and play the Taiwan card to contain China, the expert said.
