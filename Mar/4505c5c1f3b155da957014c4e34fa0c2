The Government Work Report delivered by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday has drawn attention worldwide after foreign media noticed the report mentioned "stability" dozens of times and focused on realizing feasible economic development targets amid increasing uncertainties and crises around the globe.Chinese experts said on Monday that the Government Work Report shows that the Chinese government has confidence to have a "good beginning" this year for its new journey after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2022, and it is prepared to take the lead in the global economic recovery. As a major world economy with high political certainty as well as great economic resilience and potential, China will maintain a stable environment for people and capital around the globe who are seeking stability and certainty in a turbulent world.Some Western media claimed the Government Work Report indicates that China set "cautious" growth targets after the "collapse of its stringent Zero-COVID policy," but analysts stressed such bad-mouthing cannot check China's potential for development but only expose certain countries' own incompetence and failure to contribute to and benefit from global recovery.Stability and developmentThe world in 2023 could still face many uncertainties. Apart from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict that could further worsen the security and economic situation of not only Europe but also the world, experts said the potential sovereign default of the US is also a huge risk for global recovery, encouraging China to be more pragmatic on setting targets. But in Chinese culture, a crisis always consists of danger and opportunity, analysts said, adding the Government Work Report shows that China has confidence to seize opportunities in a turbulent world to realize its own goals and inject hope and momentum into the global recovery.China set its annual GDP growth target at around 5 percent for 2023, as the country embarked on a rapid economic recovery after a decisive victory against COVID-19, with emphasis on ensuring economic stability and high-quality growth, sustainable development amid global economic volatility and geopolitical uncertainty.Shen Yi, a professor of politics and international relations at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Monday that "the Government Work Report has presented a thorough response to the demands from the people for development, employment, education, public health, environmental protection and so on, as well as for national security and national reunification. It underlined a series of tasks and presented visions based on the current domestic and international situations."Some forces, especially the US and some of its allies, are destabilizing the international order with irresponsible foreign policy and hegemonic behaviors, which have forced China to make more efforts to ensure stability for development, experts said.Many other major world economies are on the brink of recession or already suffer from that, Shen said. "Due to the US' irresponsible strategy and selfish financial and economic policies, the potential sovereign default of the US has become a huge, systemic risk for the fragile world economy, and Washington keeps fueling the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, putting China's development under increasing challenges."According to the Financial Times on February 16, the US government risks an unprecedented default as soon as July if the debt ceiling is not raised, the Congressional Budget Office warned amid a growing war of words between the White House and congressional Republicans over lifting the borrowing limit.Meanwhile, the US' worrisome domestic governance and partisan struggles are putting the world economy at risk since the US economy is so intertwined with all other major economies. How to find a way for global recovery that can effectively prevent uncertainties brought by Washington is a common concern shared by many, said a Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity.Seeking stability does not contradict embracing changes, Shen said, but China wants to make sure the world will change in a constructive way, so the international order and system can reform and be more reasonable and equal."If China can successfully pass the test of the current turbulence and realize recovery and high-quality development, then it would show how a responsible major power could take a lead in a changing world for a positive direction," Shen said.

But Chinese analysts said that it is a trick played by some non-regional forces, and as China masters the pace of national reunification, it will not allow any forces to use the Taiwan question to repeat the tragedy of Ukraine in this region.
