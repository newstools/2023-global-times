He had met with leaders and diplomats including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Gernman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Mongolian Foreign Minister Batmunkh Battsetseg. He will continue his visit to Hungary and Russia after attending the MSC.When meeting Scholz, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said China is ready to fully restart exchanges with Germany and Europe in various fields, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and enhance mutual understanding, Xinhua News Agency reported. Both China and Germany should support multilateralism and free trade, reject practices of "decoupling" and severing supply chains, and safeguard the stability of global production and supply chains, Wang said.  Although China and Germany have different social systems and cultural backgrounds, safeguarding world peace and promoting global development serves the common interests of the two countries and is also the two's common responsibility, the Chinese diplomat told Baerbock. Zhao Junjie, a research fellow from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of European Studies, told the Global Times on Saturday that bilateral face-to-face communication is important in dispelling mistrust and enhancing mutual understanding when China and Europe face bumps in their relations. Stable and sound China-Germany relations are crucial to China and Europe rebooting ties considering Germany's status as a major regional country, being member of both the EU and NATO, Zhao said. Lü Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Wang's trip could play a constructive role in mediating peace between Russia and the NATO, and help the world find common ground in post-COVID recovery.  With the Russia-Ukraine conflict dominating the MSC agenda, China's role is not only to deliver its broad security vision, but also to show the world that despite of differences and disagreements with some countries, China, as a responsible major power, can have dialogue and cooperate in a mutually beneficial way rather than getting indulged in confrontational mentality, analysts said. The MSC, traditionally focusing more on transatlantic partnership, has invited delegations from emerging economies this year as the world is facing grave conflicts and uncertainties. During his meeting with Bilawal, Wang stressed China and Pakistan's strategic consensus on building an even closer community of shared future in the new era, Xinhua reported. The two sides also exchanged views on strengthening mutual support under the current international situation.Commenting on the recent "China-US balloon row," Wang pointed out that the unintended entry of a Chinese civilian unmanned airship into US airspace was due to force majeure, and this isolated, unexpected incident should have been handled calmly, rationally and professionally.However, the US ignored the basic facts, abused force, overreacted and hyped the situation, he said, adding that this almost hysterical practice showed that the US' prejudice and ignorance of China has reached an absurd level.China demands that the US show sincerity in solving the problem and stop doing such absurd things out of domestic political needs, Wang said.When he met with Battsetseg, the senior diplomat expressed the willingness to enhance cooperation on areas including trade, mining, infrastructure, anti-desertification and cultural exchanges. With the impact of the Ukraine crisis casting a shadow over the global stability and economic recovery, China's stance is consistent - promoting peace talks, urging de-escalation, and calling for mutual understanding and cooperation to replace a policy of decoupling and bloc confrontation, analysts said.
