Li said the financial assistance provided by China is to support the IAEA for technical assistance to Ukraine.IAEA monitors have been posted to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of Europe's largest power stations with six reactors, since September 2022, read a report from Reuters, adding that the station remains near the front line with each side accusing the other of shelling it and risking a nuclear catastrophe.The presence of these monitors was "indispensable to help reduce the risk of a nuclear accident," said IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. "Our courageous experts - working closely with the plant's operating staff - are providing technical advice and monitoring the situation in extremely difficult and challenging circumstances," he added.China attaches great importance to the issue of nuclear security and is actively committed to international cooperation in this field. The Chinese Foreign Ministry earlier issued the Global Security Initiative Concept Paper, which makes it clear that promoting international cooperation on nuclear security is a priority area for cooperation, Mao said.China will continue to work with the international community to promote the establishment of an international nuclear security system featuring fairness, cooperation and win-win results, the spokesperson said, noting that the Chinese side will continue to promote peace talks and support the political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, so as to remove nuclear security risks and promote the safety of Ukraine's nuclear facilities.Global Times
