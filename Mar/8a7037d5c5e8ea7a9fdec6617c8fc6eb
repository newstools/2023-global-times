He is also founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology. China has witnessed the fast growth of digital and industrial digitization in recent years. The scale of China's digital economy reached 45.5 trillion yuan ($6.54 trillion) in 2021, ranking second in the world, and accounted for 39.8 percent of the country's GDP, according to a white paper released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July last year. With the rapid development of digital technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, many high-tech companies have improved their operational efficiency and demonstrated strong economic resilience and potential by leveraging these digital technologies.Shenzhen Kinwong Electronic Co is a high-tech manufacturing company that focuses on the research and development, production and sales of printed circuit boards. In the past, due to the highly automated production of printed circuit boards, workers had to closely monitor machines to prevent errors.After continuous exploration, the company developed a digital and mobile platform based on Tencent's WeCom, which connects machines, workers and equipment engineers, forming an efficient digital closed-loop processing chain. "Now, even before I can make a phone call, the equipment engineer has already arrived on site," Huang told the Global Times on Wednesday. Zuo said that the trend of the digital economy is to jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace, with all countries to share the data dividend, which will play a positive role in expanding data imports and exports and promoting the development of cross-border trade.
