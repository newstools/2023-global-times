With the optimization and adjustment of epidemic prevention and control measures, and the resumption of business at ski resorts, public enthusiasm for ice and snow sports has once again exploded. It is reported that hotel bookings are close to returning to the same levels they wereÂ  in 2021, and various ski resorts are already fully booked. The public's growing enthusiasm for ice and snow is inseparable from the success of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, which has made more people fall in love with ice and snow sports, especially young people. With a significant increase in the number of public participants, ice and snow sports in China have transitioned from the minority to the public, from the region to the entire country, and from winter to the entire year. It is believed that with the adjustment and optimization of the epidemic prevention and control policy, this winter, ice and snow sports are bound to continue to set off a new wave of enthusiasm. The changes brought by the Beijing Winter Olympics to Beijing and even Chinese society are becoming more and more visible.
