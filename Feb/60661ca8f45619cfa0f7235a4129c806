Illustration: Xia Qing/GTAs China's tourism is bouncing back, the inconvenience brought by modern management of many tourist attractions toward seniors has once again caught the public eye. For the majority of scenic spots, in a bid to precisely control the visit flows and also make booking easier, online reservations have become the mainstream. But for the elderly, especially for those deficient in essential knowledge on how to access the internet, online booking seems to be an obstacle preventing them from visiting these sites. Senior people should not be abandoned by new technologies. While improving public services, technological progress should also make the lives of the elderly more convenient, rather than creating more difficulties. In the digital era, all of society must think as to how they can respect them. Tourist attractions ought to consider more when upgrading their services - whether they are user-friendly from the perspective of the elderly, and if not, what supplements should be made. It should not only apply to tourism. Some other sectors, such as healthcare, must also take that into account.
