China is hoping to help the relevant parties engage in more dialogue and increase mutual trust through diplomatic activities, as China is the only major power in the world that can play a mediating role in promoting talks between Russia and the West," Cui told the Global Times.Several global leaders, including US Vice President Kamala Harris, will be attending the Munich conference, media reported. Whether Wang and Harris will have a bilateral interaction during the event is not yet known, but Li believed that participants of the Munich conference will be keen to discuss the development of China-US relations, and it will be a focal point of the event.China-US ties have been undermined by Washington's irrational moves highlighted by its recent use of force in shooting down a Chinese civilian unmanned airship, while China has shown reason and been responsible in handling its relations with the US. Whether the two sides can ease tensions in bilateral ties depends on whether the US can correct its wrongdoings, Li noted.
