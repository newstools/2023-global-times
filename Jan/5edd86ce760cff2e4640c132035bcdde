Since then, the Lhasa, the Anshan, the Wuxi, the Dalian and the Yan’an have also entered service.Shi Hong, executive chief editor of the Shipborne Weapons magazine, told the Global Times that the Type 055 is the world's best destroyer in terms of comprehensive capabilities, and the continued commissioning of ships in this class will contribute to the PLA Navy's combat capabilities.China reportedly launched an eighth Type 055 in August 2020. While the eighth ship’s commissioning has yet to be announced, but it is expected to happen soon according to the general shipbuilding pattern, analysts said.
