The action was hailed by the US President Joe Biden as “a success,” according to US media reports. “The balloon does not belong to the US, it belongs to China,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said at Tuesday’s regular press briefing. The US said it has no plans to return debris from the balloon, according to media reports.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on February 3 when answering a question that the civilian airship is used for research, mainly meteorological purposes.
