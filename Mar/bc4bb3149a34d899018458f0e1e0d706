A series of hegemonic actions of the US have seriously interrupted the global supply and industrial chains, threatening other countries' rightful development.Experts said these are deeply changing the world and these are also the reasons why Xi said at the report to the 20th CPC National Congress in October 2022 that "Our country has entered a period of development in which strategic opportunities, risks, and challenges are concurrent and uncertainties and unforeseen factors are rising. Various 'black swan' and 'gray rhino' events may occur at any time.""We must therefore be more mindful of potential dangers, be prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms. On the journey ahead, we must firmly adhere to the following major principles," Xi noted in the report delivered on October 16, 2022.In the past decade, even under the difficult situation of dealing with serious pressures like the COVID-19 pandemic and all-out US containment, China has achieved a series great goals in development and reform, such as completed building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and overcome many internal and external challenges and solve many long-standing problems, such as a far-reaching anti-corruption drive that brings back a clean political environment and comprehensive military reform that greatly improves the combat capability of the PLA, analysts said.These all prove that with "the establishment of Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and the establishment of the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era," which is known as the "Two Establishments," the Party can successfully lead the whole country to sail through winds and waves, so that China will firmly remain and uphold these advantages to begin its new journey toward realizing the Chinese modernization and the national rejuvenation, despite it is also likely to see more dangerous storms and waves ahead, said experts.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday that "the leaders that were elected today have proven to be qualified and successful leaders with wisdom and strategic views in past 10 years based on the remarkable achievements they made. The election result provides confidence to the whole society, and also provides certainty to the international community as all nations will see the strong political stability and consistency of China."The world, which is suffering from turbulence and uncertainty, also wants to see China, a major power with a second largest economy and growing international influence, to be certain, stable and consistent, and the election result is providing what the world a clear answer from China, as China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting world peace and development, and to make its contribution to guiding global recovery, and to promote, reform and improve globalization when the globalization trend sees backlash due to the unfair and uneven order dominated by the West, Li said.Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Friday that the Party's leadership and the strong leadership core of the Party and the state provide China a key and unique advantage to overcome challenges in a volatile global landscape, including to handle the fragmented globalization by reinforcing and promoting strategic partnerships with different countries around the globe and to deal with the extreme and all-out US suppression targeting China's development.In the long journey toward the Chinese modernization and the great rejuvenation of Chinese nation, a stable and efficient political system and correct strategies and policies are crucial, but more important is we need right and qualified people to best use these advantages and to correctly implement the policies by actions, and also to handle emergent and unpredictable impacts and seize opportunities in the crisis, Wang noted.In the future, China will keep marching with confidence and belief as the election of new leaders has brought new certainty and energy, making the whole nation more united and determined no matter what kind of waves and storms occur, experts remarked.
