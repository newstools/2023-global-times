Detailed carving was completed before the arms were attached, according to the China National Cultural Heritage Administration. The pit yielded a variety of weapons with different lengths and functions, including long-range attack weapons, shields for defense, as well as drums and drumsticks used for commanding soldiers.The third excavation of No.1 pit began in 2009, covering an area of about 430 square meters. More than 220 terracotta figures, 16 terracotta horses, four chariots and other cultural relics such as weapons and production tools have been identified to date.A ruin site in Northwest China’s Shaanxi Province was excavated recently and archeologists discovered remains of some architectures such as temples, dwellings and shops as well as sculptures with features of both Han and Mongolian ethnic groups.It is believed that this site served as a market between the two groups during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and reflects the fusion of different ethnic groups in ancient China.
