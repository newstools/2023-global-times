The successful summit held in Shanghai was the largest of all previous events held within the framework of the CICA, the ambassador noted.The establishment of the CICA has facilitated a new mechanism to find mutually acceptable solutions to regional security issues. Its uniqueness lies in the common understanding of CICA member states that peace and stability in Asia can only be achieved through dialogue, cooperation and enhanced mutual trust, he said.To cope with a shift in the traditional architecture of international security, the CICA remains firmly committed to its primary objectives - to serve as a platform for political dialogue and collaboration and to strengthen trust. At the same time, current trends in global geopolitics and economics require a realignment of the content and form of cooperation within the CICA's framework, Sarybay suggested. The ambassador expressed appreciation for China's support for the CICA's transformation initiative.Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui spoke highly of the CICA's activities in ensuring regional security, strengthening political dialogue and confidence-building measures at the award ceremony, saying that China is willing to support further activities of the CICA.Chinese representatives hailed the role of the CICA in consolidating cooperation among member states to serve peace, security and stability and to promote tolerance, human coexistence, dialogue and sustainable development in the Asian continent and the whole world.The CICA now has 28 member states, nine observer states, and five observer organizations. The Summit of the CICA was held in the Republic of Kazakhstan in October 2022.
