He told the Global Times at the booth of the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency that his unit's role includes maritime search and rescue, fishery protection, anti-drug operation, anti-piracy efforts and counterterrorism, with many Chinese elements playing key roles.When fishing boats encounter dangerous waves or face other accidents, the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency is able to reach the site and carry out rescue missions with the fastest speed thanks to its induction of vessels made by China and its application of Chinese methods, Awan said.Having served on the PMSS Kashimir for two years, Awan said the vessel built in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province was commissioned in 2018. Compared with another type of vessel built by another country Awan had served on, the Chinese vessel excels because the Chinese shipbuilder designed it based on the operational methods of the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency. "It makes everything go very smoothly," he said.Since the maritime environment around Pakistan is complicated, the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency is also in charge of providing security for passing commercial ships, Awan said.The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency's participation in the PIMEC also aims at displaying its capabilities to the public, Awan said.Another Chinese-built ship that has won positive ratings from Pakistan is the Type 054A/P guided missile frigate, which was the most attractive vessel displayed at the AMAN-23's opening ceremony.Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi, chief of the Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview prior to the exercise that the Type 054A/P is one of the latest multi-role frigates of Chinese origin, equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and sensors.The first two ships of this class were previously inducted into the Pakistan Navy - the PNS Tughril in December 2021 and the PNS Taimur in June 2022. The remaining two ships are on track to join the Pakistan Navy Fleet this year, said the naval chief.Â These ships are being integrated into Pakistan Navy operations, and they will be mainstays in the Pakistan Navy Fleet in the coming years, ensuring the seaward defense and protection of Pakistan's vital sea lines of communication, he said.A Pakistan Navy officer who served as the executive officer on an F-22P frigate, which is the previous class of warship China built for Pakistan, told the Global Times that he will receive a newly commissioned Type 054A/P in 2023.He said that the F-22P is a very good vessel, and he expects the Type 054A/P to further enhance the Pakistan Navy's capabilities.
