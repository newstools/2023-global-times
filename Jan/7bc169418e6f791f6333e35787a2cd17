The US announced the possible sale of Volcano anti-tank mine-laying system to Taiwan for an estimated $180 million on December 28, 2022, and sent the USS Chung-Hoon guided missile destroyer through the Taiwan Straits on Thursday.The PLA's large-scale exercises around the island of Taiwan has become routine, and they take place not only when the PLA announces them, but on a daily basis, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.If external interference and "Taiwan independence" forces continue to provoke, the PLA will also intensify its drills, which not only warn them, but also practically enhance combat readiness in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the expert said.In 2022, the PLA sent 1,727 planes into the island of Taiwan's self-proclaimed air defense identification zone, compares with about 960 incursions in 2021 and 380 in 2020, AFP reported, citing releases by the defense authority on the island.The AFP report noted that the growth in PLA aircraft sorties in 2022 could be a result of the PLA's response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit on the island in August.Kevin McCarthy, who was elected as the new House Speaker on Saturday, should also understand the signal the PLA has sent, analysts said.
