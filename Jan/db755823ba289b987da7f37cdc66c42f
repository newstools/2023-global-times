In 2021, EU members imported 155 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia, which accounted for 45 percent of the bloc's gas imports, according to figures released by the International Energy Agency (IEA).However, Europe has been deeply hurt by the sweeping sanctions the West imposed on Russia since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, exacerbating the severe energy shortage there.Russian gas giant Gazprom exported 100.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas to countries outside the former Soviet Union in 2022, down 46 percent year-on-year, Bloomberg reported, citing Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller. The company's deliveries to Europe have been shrinking for months, as Russia hits back at Europe's sanctions, according to the report.The EU could face a shortfall of nearly 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2023, according to the IEA. The agency predicted that the EU's potential gas supply-demand gap could reach 7.6 percent of the EU's total natural gas demand, which is estimated at 395 billion cubic meters for 2023.The EU will probably become "a piece of fat meat" for the US, as the US is striving to replace Russia to be the largest energy supplier to Europe by pushing it to cut Russian supplies, Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.In addition to weakening Russia through the sweeping sanctioning measures, the US also wants to weaken the global competitiveness of the EU - the only power capable of competing with the US in cutting-edge technologies at present - and to reap political, economic and energy benefits, Zhang said.The European Commission in November predicted that the 27-nation EU bloc would contract both in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.European industry is losing its competitiveness and appeal among investors due to high energy prices, Thomas Schäfer, brand chief executive officer (CEO) of German carmaker Volkswagen, said in a post on social media in late November."Europe is not cost-competitive in many areas, in particular, when it comes to the costs of electricity and gas," he said.As a result, some European businesses in certain industries have been forced to relocate or will go bankrupt, while some countries have injected liquidity into enterprises in trouble, according to media reports.Uncertainties and challenges will continue to batter Europe, and the continent should resist the impact of US geopolitics and economic hegemony, according to Lin.
