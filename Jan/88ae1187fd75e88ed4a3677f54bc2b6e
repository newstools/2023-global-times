In addition to discovering a large number of iron and manganese nodules at the bottom of the Diamantina Trench, the team of the abyss scientific expedition also placed markers saying "Happy Year of the Rabbit" at the depth of 5,810 meters in the trench. The submersible will return to Sanya city in early March 2023 as planned, after performing 22 dives in the area.Global Times
