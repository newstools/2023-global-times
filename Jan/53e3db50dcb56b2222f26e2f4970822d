Currently, the XBB variant has not spread widely in China, according to Chen.The main strains currently circulating in China are BA.5.2 and BF.7. The neutralizing antibodies produced by BA.5.2 or BF7-infected individuals remain at a high level in the short term, and offer better cross-protection against variants including XBB, China's CDC said in a previous press conference.A new COVID variant known as XBB.1.5 is spreading fast in the US and threatening to cause further waves of infection. It's one of the latest descendants of Omicron, causing the number of cases in the US to more than double in a week at the end of December.Global Times
