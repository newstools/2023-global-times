Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning Photo:fmprc.gov.cn China firmly opposed politicizing COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reiterated on Monday, urging individual countries to lift their discriminatory measures against China arrivals.South Korea said it will continue to restrict the entry of short-term travelers from China through the end of February over the so-called concerns that the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea may worsen following the Chinese New Year holidays, media reported on Friday.In response, Mao Ning, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a routine press briefing on Monday that in January, certain countries announced temporary epidemic measures for travelers from China. China has taken relevant measures based on the principle of reciprocity in accordance with different circumstances.Mao said that South Korea's extension of its decision to stop issuing short-term visas at its consulates in China is not conducive to personnel exchanges and cooperation between the two countries. We hope that South Korea will end the unreasonable moves as soon as possible, she said, noting that China is ready to take corresponding measures to facilitate personnel exchanges between the two countries on this basis.

The 72/144-hour visa-free transit policy will be reinstated," the Chinese National Immigration Administration also said on Sunday.In response to the latest positive development over exchanges between China and Japan, Mao stressed on Monday that China is ready to work with other parties to create more convenience for normal exchanges between Chinese and overseas personnel. She also noted that China firmly opposes politicizing epidemic prevention and control.Global Times
