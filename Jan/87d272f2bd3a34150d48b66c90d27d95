The spokesperson said countries should not impose discriminatory practices and should not affect normal personnel exchanges and cooperation between countries. "We also remind Chinese citizens to confirm their health status before leaving the country, fully understand the entry requirements of the destination country, and avoid affecting their itinerary," Mao said. In response to the latest remarks from the WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus who said he understands why some countries have reintroduced travel restrictions amid surging COVID-19 cases in China, Mao emphasized that the epidemic situation in China is under control.
