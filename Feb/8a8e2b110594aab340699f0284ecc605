The field is also close to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities.To ensure energy security amid a highly volatile global market, China has been ramping up domestic output and expanding its energy storage capacity in recent years.On Wednesday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) revised up global crude demand for 2023, due to China's optimization of epidemic control measures. Global crude demand will be driven up by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 101.9 million bpd, according to the IEA's latest oil market report. Of the total, 900,000 bpd will go to a "resurgent China," it said.Global Times
