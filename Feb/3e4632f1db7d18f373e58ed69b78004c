For the business exhibition, as of Wednesday, the number of contracted enterprise participants worldwide has surpassed 500, and the exhibition area has exceeded 200,000 square meters, said the bureau during the Seminar on International Communication of the CIIE held on Friday.Cosmetics giant L'Oréal has been the largest participant of the sector in the last five expos. Lan Zhenzhen, chief corporate affairs and engagement officer of L'Oréal North Asia and China, said at the seminar that the CIIE takes responsibilities for imports and exports, and further enhances international cooperation.Ji Tao, US bureau chief for China Daily, said at the seminar that the China-US trade volume reached a record high despite all the "decoupling" that has been hyped by some politicians in the US. This demonstrates that the economic structures of the two countries are highly complementary."It is recommended to further highlight the benefits of the CIIE for foreign small and medium-sized enterprises and local industries, as well as factors such as green environmental protection and sustainable consumption. It is also worth considering holding CIIE-related activities overseas," said Ji.Global Times
