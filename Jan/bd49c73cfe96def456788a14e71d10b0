Safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests is the highest principle of 'one country, two systems' in HKSAR," Chen said.The promulgation and enforcement of the NSL for Hong Kong is an important milestone in the development of the practice of "one country, two systems" since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Xia pointed out. Since the implementation of the law, the mechanism for safeguarding the NSL in Hong Kong has been continuously improved, and national security has been effectively safeguarded. Facts have proved that the implementation of the law is entirely in line with the reality of Hong Kong, which has ensured Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, according to Xia.Wu Yingpeng, a lawyer and barrister-at-law in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Friday that the NSL for Hong Kong is superior in force to any local laws in HKSAR. "HKSAR's legal system is an important part of China's legal mechanism. We should correctly understand the authoritative status of the NSL from the national constitutional level, especially the overriding role of the NSL over HKSAR's local laws."When the local legislation is inconsistent with the NSL for Hong Kong, the court shall apply the provisions of the national security law with priority, Wu said.
