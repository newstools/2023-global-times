Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin Photo: VCGUS high-altitude balloons have illegally flown over Chinese airspace on more than 10 occasions without the approval of the relevant Chinese authorities since January 2022, and the first thing the US should do is to reflect on its own behavior, instead of slandering, smearing and provoking confrontation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at Monday's regular press briefing.A Chinese civilian unmanned airship's unintended entry into US airspace was due to force majeure and the incident was totally an accident, according to Wang. China firmly opposed the US use of force to attack China's civilian unmanned airship, which was indiscriminate use of force and overacted, said Wang.For a long time, the US has abused its technological advantages to carry out large-scale indiscriminate clandestine operations and stealing of secrets across the world, including its allies, violating the sovereignty and interests of other countries and regions, and violating the international law and basic norms of international relations, Wang said. The US is deservedly the world's largest repeat offender for spying and use of surveillance empire, Wang noted.The US has also frequently sent aircraft and warships to conduct close-in reconnaissance on China, with 657 flights in 2022 and 64 flights in the South China Sea in January this year alone, which seriously jeopardizes China's national security and undermines regional peace and stability, Wang said. It is also common for US balloons to illegally enter other countries' airspace, Wang noted.China's handling of the matters is responsible and professional, Wang said, in response to the question over how China responded to US high-altitude balloons illegally flying over Chinese airspace on at least 10 occasions.
