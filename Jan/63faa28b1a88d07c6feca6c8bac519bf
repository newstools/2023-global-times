A total of 30 8,000-meter extra-deep wells have completed drilling, also a record high, the state broadcaster CCTV reported in November, citing CNPC.Despite the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tarim Oilfield has supplied over 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas to support economic development in southern Xinjiang. More than 3,000 kilometers of pipes have been installed, providing natural gas to 42 counties and cities in southern Xinjiang, and 73 gas-supply stations have been set up, according to the company.Global Times
