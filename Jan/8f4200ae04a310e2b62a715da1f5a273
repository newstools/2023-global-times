Luosifen Photo: VCGTaiwan authorities' order to take off the market a rice noodle product made in the Chinese mainland has sparked taunts from the netizens on the island, who said the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is the one that should be removed.Liuzhou snail rice noodle, also known as Luosifen in Chinese, an offbeat Chinese dish that gained popularity among many Chinese people, has been ordered off the shelves by the Taiwan authorities over so-called "propaganda" on the packaging and import violations, according to Taiwan-based media outlets.The pungent-smelling rice noodle productÂ recently exported from the mainland to the island of Taiwan was found to have a sentence "You are Chinese and so am I; round it up and you are mine" printed on its packaging.During a press conference on Sunday, Tainan city councilor Lee Chong-lim of the Taiwan Statebuilding Party (TSP) which advocates "Taiwan independence," said the noodle product has violated the trade regulations and he believed it was part of mainland authorities' "unification propaganda."Taiwan economic affairs authority released a statement on Monday night saying that it issued an order to pull the product from the market.In response to the authorities' move, internet users on the island left messages questioning whether the ban on the import of the noodle product is based on laws and regulations or just because of the printings on its packaging.A netizen said in a message that what should be taken off the shelves in 2024 is the DPP. Another netizen said that a vulnerable heart can be sensitive to anything. What a disgrace for the councilor to get fussy about the witticism on the product's packaging, another netizen said.Global Times
