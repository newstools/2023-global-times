It also actively promotes peaceful use of nuclear energy to make it serve for the benefits of the humans. China has attached high importance on the international cooperation of peaceful use of nuclear energy and has made significant contribution to maintain the security of nuclear facilities and decrease the risk of nuclear proliferation, Mao said.The US, as the most powerful nuclear armed power, should take a responsible nuclear policy. However, it has promoted nuclear power, strengthened nuclear weapons in its national policies, promoted military allies and drawn small circles with Cold War mentality by boosting nuclear deterrence and nuclear submarine cooperation, said Mao.The US is the biggest nuclear threat for the world. It should make a thorough reflection on its nuclear policy, abide by the responsibilities in nuclear disarmament, make concrete actions to decrease nuclear risk and take the responsibility in defending the regional and global peace and strategic stability, said Mao.Global Times
