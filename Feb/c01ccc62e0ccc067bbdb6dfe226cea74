The US' F-35 often comes attached with many political and military restrictions, while Russia's Su-57 is also limited in production capacity and is questionable in terms of stealth performance, analysts said.When the domestic-use version of the FC-31 enters service with the PLA, the aircraft will become even more attractive to the international market, observers said.
