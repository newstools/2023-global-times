Photo: VCGChinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang urged Japan to keep its promises and act prudently on historical issues, on the Taiwan question and in the field of military security. It comes amid efforts by NATO to seek stronger ties with the country to counter China.In a phone call with his Japanese counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi on Thursday, Qin said China and Japan should exclude disturbances and put bilateral relations on the right track under the consensus that the two countries are cooperative partners and not a threat to each other.Qin said he hoped Japan would behave cautiously on sensitive issues including the Taiwan question and the military security area, and that it would stop provocations by right-wing forces over the Diaoyu Islands. "Both sides should adhere to strategic autonomy and work together to build Asia well," said Qin.Two days before the two ministers' phone call, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday called for stronger partnership with Japan to counter China after repeatedly hyping the "China threat" theory over the South China Sea issue and the Taiwan question. Stoltenberg also hailed Japan's plan to double its defense spending.Media reports earlier this week said that the US government had secured a deal with the Netherlands and Japan to impose new restrictions on exports of chip-making goods to China. Qin said in the phone call that Japan should conduct economic, trade and scientific cooperation with China based on market principles and the spirit of freedom and openness.Qin also reiterated the concerns from China and international society about Japan's decision to dump nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. Earlier on Thursday, Qin held talks in Beijing with Csaba Korosi, president of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and the two sides emphasized protecting the earth with a responsible attitude.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said Japan is willing to build constructive and stable relations with China by implementing the consensus reached by the two countries' leaders, as well as enhancing talks at all levels and promoting practical cooperation.Global Times
