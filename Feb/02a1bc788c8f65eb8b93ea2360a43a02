The two sides should maintain open cooperation, refuse to decouple and disconnect, and jointly maintain the stability of the global production and supply chain, Wang stated. Borrell said that Europe has been promoting the development of relations with China with a mature and candid attitude and that Europe is committed to the one-China policy, recognizing that the government of People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government representing China and supporting China in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity will implement this principle into EU-China political relations.The EU hopes to strengthen high-level exchanges with China and promote cooperation in various fields, which is beneficial to Europe, China and the world, the EU's top diplomat said. The EU is willing to work with China to make necessary preparations for the next EU-China leaders' meeting and exchange views in depth on issues of common concern.When discussing topics related to the Ukraine crisis, Wang emphasized that China insists on promoting peace talks and is willing to enhance communication with the Europe, and persevere in finding a political solution. Wang also stressed that in the face of global volatility, China and the EU should strengthen cooperation so they can inject more stability into the international landscape. Global Times
