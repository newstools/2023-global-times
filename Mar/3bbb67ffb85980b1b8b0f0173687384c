More than 200 schools have signed up to depart between June and August, Choi said.She said the field trips will have one- to three-day itineraries that are primarily aligned with the school's curriculum, with visits and exchanges focused on connecting with learning, and activities designed to include more active thinking and interactive elements that are believed to be in-depth.The trips are part of HKSAR's education reform, as the Citizenship and Social Development subject replaced the Liberal Studies as one of the four core subjects of senior secondary education from the 2021/22 school year, and it will be included in the Diploma of Secondary Education exams starting from 2024.Due to previous travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, April 2023 will see the first Hong Kong students to participate in this expedition.The field trips are organized and fully funded by the Hong Kong Education Bureau (EDB), and are compulsory for secondary four to six students in Hong Kong, according to the EDB's notice in July 2022, Hong Kong media outlet The Standard reported. According to a notice sent by the EDB to secondary schools in February, there are 22 routes available for study tours. The themes of the trips include the history of the Communist Party of China, the development of China's innovative technology and the contribution of world-renowned revolutionist Sun Yat-sen. Choi said that students can learn about the latest developments, culture and history of the country from field trips, which will be extremely helpful for learning, emphasizing that the purpose of the tour is not tourism and that it is appropriate to include elements of reflection and interaction in the design of activities for students.
