But those studying abroad or travelling for business will still be able to visit these countries after receiving approval from their residential community or village and the local police station at least three days before their departure.The notice was targeting those suspected of engaging telecom fraud rather than ordinary residents, said a representative from the Enshi public security bureau on Wednesday. Sources familiar with the matter said Enshi public security bureau deleted the notice as it failed to correctly and clearly express the social consensus of combating telecom scam, Shangyou News reported.In the deleted notice, Enshi police also called on its residents living in the eight countries who have been designated by the Ministry of Public Security as high-risk groups to immediately contact local police authorities in Enshi before returning to China. According to the Ministry of Public Security, China has solved 319,000 cases of telecom and internet fraud, as well as 37,527 cross-border gambling cases in 2022.In June 2022, China launched a one-year-long targeted campaign called "Pulling out nails" aimed at disrupting the heads and key personnel coordinating telecom fraud groups, in addition to those involved with offshore gambling houses, kidnapping and drug trafficking offences. Global Times
