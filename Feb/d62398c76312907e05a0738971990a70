In the first section, the orchestra will present classic "spring" songs such as waltzes Voice of Spring created by composer Johann Strauss II and Nao Yuan Xiao (Lit: Celebrating the Lantern Festival) composed by Chinese artist Bao Yuankai. To celebrate the one-year anniversary of the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, the second part will present audiences with Olympics-themed songs. "Xue Hua" (Lit: Snowflake), the 2022 Winter Olympics' song, and "You and Me," the theme song of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, will also be performed. 2023 Greater Bay Area light show Displaying more than 40 light sculptures, the 2023 Bay Area ­Super Lantern show is creating a festive Spring Festival atmosphere to the Guangdong-Hong ­Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The 2023 edition of the annual event takes Chinese art as inspiration. The exhibit is a resplendent lamp sea some 20,000 square meters in size. By incorporating ancient aesthetics into China's modern GBA landscape, the exhibition is dedicated to showing the how Chinese civilization has extended from the past to the present. The event, scheduled to end on February 26, has also invited artisans from Zigong, known as Chinese lantern town, in ­Sichuan Province to create on-site ­installations, such as lanterns featuring fish swimming through mountains and seas, and lanterns that show figures from the murals at the Dunhuang Grottoes.
