For example, the volume of railway freight, power generation and the balance of yuan loans all grew steadily.The NBS said China's official manufacturing PMI in February rebounded by 2.5 percentage points to 52.6, hitting an 11-year high, which shows that market players are upbeat in the growth potential in 2023 and beyond. China's changing economic outlook has added positive factors for the world economy too."Since February, many international organizations have become less pessimistic about the world economy, and have also raised their forecasts for world economic growth in 2023 because of China's rapid recovery," Kang said.Experts said that Kang's remarks sent a positive message about the market recovery trend for China and the world, and it again highlighted the government's confidence in stabilizing economic growth this year, despite challenges.Judging from various indicators in the past two months, the recovery trend is obvious, such as domestic consumption and investment, Li Chang'an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Sunday.Li expects a stronger economic recovery starting the second quarter this year, with expanding market demand becoming the main driver of the growth. "Judging from the current situation, the most severely hit industries in the past three years, including tourism and catering, have bounced back the fastest, which may continue to provide a more vigorous pulling effect for the rest of the year," said Li. The services sector also provides the most jobs.But lingering external and internal challenges may affect a full economic recovery, as Kang also noted at the press briefing on Sunday.The development environment is complicated, and there are still deep-seated and structural problems in the domestic economy, he said, such as employment difficulties and slow income growth.The pressure on China from the unrelenting US "decoupling" attempt may also escalate, experts said.US moves to decouple from China in technology would cause disruptions to normal global supply chain. And, the radical US monetary tightening, especially the steep interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, my overshadow the economic recovery, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Sunday.
