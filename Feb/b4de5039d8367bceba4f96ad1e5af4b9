As friendship cities, the BrusselsCapital Region and Beijing have cooperated on many projects in the fields of art, food, tourism, trade and investment, as evidenced by the fact that Hub.brussels has been part of the China International Fair for Trade in Services for four consecutive years. Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the Friendship City relationship, and the two sides are looking forward to more practical cooperation under this framework. Goessens also provided an update on the progress of the new Belgian Embassy in Beijing, where all the bricks were taken from the old embassy and made from recycled materials. The new embassy also employs advanced technology to ensure that the building is low-energy and environmentally friendly. In addition, the new embassy will create a harmonious ecosystem for local flora and fauna, helping maintain Beijing's biodiversity. These efforts are a testament to the importance of the relationship between Belgium and China.
