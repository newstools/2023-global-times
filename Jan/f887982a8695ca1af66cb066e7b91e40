Through video surveillance and on-site observation, the breeders kept an eye on the pandas’ behavior and physical state.The center has the world's largest captive giant panda population, at 364.The successful birth of twin cubs helps a lot to enlarge the panda population. Li Dehong, a breeder at the center, said that wild giant pandas usually give up after giving birth to twin cubs as they cannot keep both alive in tough natural conditions, but at the breeding center, workers are ready to help the cubs as soon as they are born. The breeders usually take one of the twin cubs out and feed them. The survival rate of twin cubs has been sharply increasing in recent years.With the rapid development of artificial panda breeding technologies in recent years, there are now more twin cubs in the world. The global captive panda population has grown to 673, nearly double the number of 10 years ago.
