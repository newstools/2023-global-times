"The Type 052D will become more powerful with these new technologies and experiences previous ships have gathered."According to publicly available information and media reports, the first Type 052D, the Kunming, was commissioned in 2014, and 25 have been launched since. Additional hulls were spotted under construction in August 2022.The Type 052D is very reliable and uses mature technologies, making it suitable for mass production, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times in a previous interview.China also displayed the export version of Type 052DE destroyer at Airshow China 2022 held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province.
