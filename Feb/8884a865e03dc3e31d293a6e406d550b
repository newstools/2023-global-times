Portugal is the first EU country to purchase made-in-China metro trains.Chinese Ambassador to Portugal Zhao Bentang was quoted by the CRRC statement as saying that the delivery of the trains demonstrates the strategic partnership between China and Portugal and the potential of higher-level bilateral cooperation, Zhao was quoted in the statement. The first train will start operation in May, and all the trains will be delivered by the end of September after trials and tests, per Xinhua. The adoption of digital technology will lower the production costs of the vehicles, while making them smarter, more environmentally friendly and comfortable, Tan Mu, general manager of CRRC Tangshan, said in the statement.The statement noted that the new-generation metro train jointly designed by CRRC Tangshan and Porto Metro company has the characteristics of light weight, low energy consumption and more digital intelligent, in accordance with the European standards.The trains have a maximum speed of 80 kilometers per hour and a capacity to carry 244 passengers, of whom 64 are seated, according to Xinhua. The Porto metro network will have 120 cars, counting these new carriages, Xinhua reported.In October 2022, the first batch of China-produced metro trains was shipped to Portugal through North China's Tianjin port.Global Times
