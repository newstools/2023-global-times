"Many Jamaican teachers have been assigned to work across China's provinces, thereby improving individual economic realities in a practical and fulfilling way," he said.China has also granted financial aid and scholarships in the medical sector to support Jamaican students to fulfill their dreams in China, the ambassador noted.Along with Hugh, major guests who attended the event included China's Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng.
