The aftershock occurred only two weeks after a massive seismic tremor killed more than 46,000 in Turkey and Syria and injured scores more.The Chinese Embassy said in the notice issued on Monday that many dwellings had collapsed in the epicenter and adjacent regions were able to feel the tremor. Currently, the earthquakes and continuing aftershock have crippled transportation and telecommunication access. Chinese citizens are advised to avoid the epicenter as a security precaution.The Chinese Embassy also reminded Chinese citizens to closely monitor warning information released by local government and related departments and take precautions and preparations for further aftershocks and secondary disasters. They can also contact the embassy in case of emergency. Smaller tremors have jolted the region over the last two weeks but the Monday quakes were the largest since February 6. Turkey's disaster agency AFAD urged residents to stay away from the Mediterranean coast due to a possible 50-centimeter rise in waters due to the quake. Videos posted on social media showed passengers at Antakya airport taking cover in panic as the quake jolted the glass building, Reuters reported. Global Times
