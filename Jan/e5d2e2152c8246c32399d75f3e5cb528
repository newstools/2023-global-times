Punishments and suspensions were also handed out and Taobao was fined.There were also some problems on social media platforms Sina Weibo and WeChat, so the cyberspace authorities had meetings with top executives from the two companies, ordering them to make rectifications and fining the platforms.There was also pornographic content, violent content, vulgar information and other issues on platforms and websites including Tencent, Sina, Douyin, Baidu and NetEase, and these problems were also dealt with according to the law.Separately, the cyberspace authorities have stepped up law enforcement in cybersecurity, data security and personal information protection. They also cracked down on major violations of laws and regulations.In accordance with the Network Security Law, Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law, Didi Global, a ride-hailing giant in China, was given an administrative punishment.In addition, the cyberspace authorities at all levels strictly implemented laws, regulations and relevant provisions, constantly standardizing online law enforcement and improving the quality of case handling, while also taking care to ensure that the facts of the cases were clearly identified, the evidence was sufficient, the application of laws was accurate, the procedures were legal, the punishment was accurate and appropriate, and that the law enforcement was strict, standardized, fair and civilized.Global Times
