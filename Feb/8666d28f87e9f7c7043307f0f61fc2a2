They also spent time testing the insulation materials used on buildings.To protect the ecosystem and environment in Antarctica, prefabricated buildings will be used to reduce on-site operation. CASIC's self-developed environmental-friendly insulation materials will also be used in the following construction.Launching its first marine satellite in May 2002, China has put a total of eight satellites into space to observe the ocean's color, temperature, marine dynamics parameters as well as the resources and ecology of coastal zones. These observations can effectively serve marine disaster monitoring, marine resources exploitation, and the development of marine economy.
