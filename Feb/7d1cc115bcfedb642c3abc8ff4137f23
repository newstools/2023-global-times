The hit sci-fi movie The Wandering Earth II has been released theatrically in at least nine overseas markets. Among these is North America, where it became one of the top 10 highest earning films of the week after its debut on January 18.Looking back, the costume drama The Untamed once trended at No.1 on Twitter in Thailand after its release in 2019."Not only are Chinese costume dramas popular among fans in ­Southeast Asia, nowadays genres ranging from suspense to ­reality shows, including stories about China's reform and opening-up and the fight against extreme poverty, are all doing well overseas and conveying Chinese values," Shang noted.TV dramas and movies have jumped to become representatives of modern Chinese culture overseas.This has led moviegoers and TV drama fans to wonder: Just who are the mysterious language bridge builders that create the subtitles that allow these works to be understood overseas?

But for subtitles, what we need to do is to simplify translations so ­audiences won't be hindered when trying to understand the story," Lu said.However, culture connotations cannot be ignored during this simplification."During the translation of a movie or TV series, the most important thing is to allow overseas audiences to understand what it means the second they hear the line and read the subtitle. Therefore it is necessary to use an amplification technique, which means increasing the number of words in a translation," an experienced Beijing-based translator, who worked on the English subtitles for the hit costume drama Weaving a Tale of Love in 2021, told the Global Times. The drama made a name for itself after it landed on YouTube's "China Zone" channel by showing exquisite embroidered clothing and grand scenes from the Tang Dynasty (618-907)."For example, the ­Chinese word longpao should have been simply translated as 'dragon robe.' Instead, we added the word 'imperial' in front of 'dragon' to indicate the robe's uniqueness inside the ancient Chinese monarchy system," the translator explained. "In this way, the audience will quickly understand its importance as the subtitles flash in front of their eyes."Another translator Chen Xuan said her team once fell into a dilemma while trying to choose between two English words when translating the script for the 2019 Chinese sci-fi comedy Crazy Alien. She noted that following the ­example of Chinese originated words such as toufu and kung fu, which have become part of the English ­lexicon, many translators tend to directly use the Chinese word baijiu instead of the English translation "­liquor" in the hopes it too will become commonplace. However, her team finally decided to go with "liquor" since they felt they needed to take foreign viewers into account, most of whom have never studied Chinese pinyin.After translating many works, ­including the 2019 movie Sheep ­without a Shepherd and animation series Yao-Chinese Folktales, Chen has learned that bad subtitles can severely alter overseas audiences' perception of stories concerning China and negatively impact the reception of a work.
