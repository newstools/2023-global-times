"It is expected that more Chinese companies will expand investment in Ecuador following the agreement," Jiang said.China and Ecuador began negotiations in February 2022, according to Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Bilateral trade rose by 44.5 percent to reach $10.95 billion in 2021 and China remained the second-largest trading partner for Ecuador.Ecuador is an important partner of China in investment and trade in Latin America. Their cooperation covers a wide range of areas, including electricity, energy, mining and transportation.The FTA deal would also have a spillover effect to deepen cooperation between China and other Latin American countries, Jiang said.The conclusion of the China-Ecuador free trade negotiations comes as the latest FTA deal between China and a Latin American country. China previously signed free trade agreements with Chile, Costa Rica and Peru.In October 2006, the China-Chile FTA came into effect, the first free trade agreement signed between China and a Latin American country. Subsequently, the China-Peru FTA entered into force in March 2010, and the China-Costa Rica FTA went into effect in August 2011.Since the agreements took effect, the three countries have seen their annual exports to China grow by double-digits, according to the MOFCOM.
