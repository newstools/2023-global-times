Plaintiffs and their supporters gather in front of the Tokyo Supreme Court in Japan on June 17, 2022. Japan's Supreme Court ruled Friday that the government is not liable for the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis, dismissing evacuees' demands that the state, not just the utility, pay compensation for damage to their lives.

For example, the Japanese authorities have made speeches to students near Fukushima saying that the nuclear-contaminated water is harmless, convincing their citizens that it has no bad effect on them.The US, the UK and other Japanese allies have kept silent over the plan, which exposed their indulgence toward Japan's move and double standard, Chang noted.
