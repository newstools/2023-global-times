They noted that the East China Sea, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits are key mission areas facing potential threats from the US and Japan, among others.Shi Hong, executive chief editor of the Chinese magazine Shipborne Weapons, told the Global Times that the 4,000 ton-class Type 054A frigate is well-balanced in multiple roles, and it can conduct coastal defense as well as far sea operations, including escort missions in the Gulf of Aden.More than 30 Type 054A frigates have entered service, meaning that the ship is reliable and cost-effective, Shi said.The Pakistan Navy has also procured four Type 054A/P frigates, with two already delivered and two to be delivered this year, the Global Times learned from the Pakistan Navy.
