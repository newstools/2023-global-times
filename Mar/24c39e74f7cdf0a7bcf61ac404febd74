The spot checking of arrivals from China will be removed from around mid-March."Plus with visas for relatives visits and business returning to normal between China and Europe, most of tourist visas have been restored, so I actually look forward to doing quite a bit of business in the future," said Song.Song now leads two tourist groups every month, each including around 40 people in it.Surprisingly, the local travel agency he works with has recently been ­experiencing a shortage of manpower and started recruiting new employees since the end of February.Huang Nuonuo, ­another Chinese tour guide in Spain, told the Global Times that he thinks it will take time to fully recover to a pre-2019 level and workers like him are paying attention to global travel policies. Things, he says, look "promising for our career."

Even though flights are being restored between China and the UK, "the tickets are still quite expensive, and this is also one of the main factors affecting our business," Li said.After the South Korean government decided to lift the pre-travel nucleic acid testing requirements for people from China starting from Wednesday, a local Chinese travel agency launched a 20 percent discount for all of their services in order to attract Chinese visitors. However, an employee on ­Wednesday revealed to the Global Times that such a discount has yet to attract more tourists partially because "we're all just restarting and we're all expectant and anxious about this new beginning."
