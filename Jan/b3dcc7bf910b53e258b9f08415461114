This new measure has set a good example for other cities nationwide.But now he has no time to rest as more supporting measures are in preparation to bolster local companies, especially small- and medium-sized firms, which were hard hit by the epidemic.The government plans more chartered flights this year, and other policies are also in place, such as subsidies of 20,000-30,000 yuan ($2970-4456) per company to attend exhibitions abroad, Fei told the Global Times on Monday. The new policies are expected to last until April."Businesspeople can meet their clients face-to-face using chartered flights, but that's mostly for old clients. New ones have to be found through expos, which yield 70 percent of the new orders," Fei said. Other steps such as helping companies find new clients and providing them with more information about destination markets will come next, the Global Times learned.The supporting measures have paid off, judging by customs data.In 2022, Zhejiang's total trade hit a record, and its export contribution rate was No.1 in China. Ningbo was a major contributor.From January to November 2022, Ningbo's total trade reached 1.16 trillion yuan, up 7 percent year-on-year, city customs data showed. Electromechanical products, a core local industry, led the exports. Exports of high-tech products and imports of some resource-based products also jumped.Ding Yandong, general manager of Rollmax shutter component Co, a local roller shutter component manufacturer, has witnessed the growth, which was backed up by the strong competitiveness of Chinese goods and government support.Ding took two of the government-organized chartered flights last year - one in July and another in November - which helped his company make a million-dollar deal and maintain old business partnerships.Chinese-made goods offer more value for money than those from other countries. A complete supply chain, especially in cities like Ningbo, offers clients a one-stop purchasing experience, Ding said.Looking into the new year, there are both new opportunities and challenges.Gu Weijun, general manager of Ningbo Huamao International Trading Co, told the Global Times on Monday that clients from the US and Europe, have gradually resumed orders and inquiries.Gu's business covers a wide range, from bulk commodities such as minerals and timber to machinery and daily commodities."We expect to maintain $25 million of goods for the US market, basically the same as last year, depending on market demand and other factors. The European market may expand about 15 percent year-on-year," Gu said."This means that our trade with European clients will reach $27 million, exceeding the level before the epidemic," she said. Weak global demand and rising oil prices, combined with inflationary concerns and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, also signal possible economic hardship.Other challenges include rising competitiveness from some Southeast Asian countries and Turkey.
