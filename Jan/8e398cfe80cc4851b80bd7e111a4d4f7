Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning Photo:fmprc.gov.cnThe US is the biggest instigator of the Ukraine crisis, but instead of reflecting on its behavior, it blames China over groundless suspicions, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday, refuting US' accusations that Chinese companies may be providing non-lethal military and economic assistance to Russia. The FM stressed China won't accept such groundless blackmail.China always follows an objective and fair approach when it comes to the Ukraine crisis, stands for peace and will continue to play a constructive part in pushing for a political solution to the crisis, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.We will not sit on the sidelines, not to fuel to the fire or take advantage of it, Mao said.The US is the initiator and the biggest instigator of the Ukraine crisis, continuing to send heavy and offensive weapons to Ukraine, which has intensified the conflict, Mao noted.Â The US does not reflect on what it has done, on the contrary, it blames China over groundless suspicions. We do not accept such groundless blackmail, nor will we sit by and see the US unreasonably harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, Mao said.Ukraine and Western countries have recently agreed to discuss an increase in military aid including long-range missiles and warplanes. The danger of "another World War" in Europe is increasing, according to Chinese military experts, as a NATO senior military official said the US-led military bloc is ready for direct confrontation with Russia.If the US sincerely hopes for an early end to the crisis and really cares about the lives and safety of the Ukrainian people, it should stop sending weapons and engaging in war profiteering, Mao said. The situation should be deescalated as soon as possible in a responsible manner, to create environment and conditions for peaceful negotiation, according to Mao.
