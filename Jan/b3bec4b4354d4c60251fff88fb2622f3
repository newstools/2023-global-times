Blueprint Beijing, an architectural exhibition that acted as the finale for the 1st Beijing Biennial, is now open at the M Woods Art Museum in Beijing. It starts with a huge timeline that introduces notable architectural moments in cities in the world such as Beijing and New York. Referring to itself as a "blueprint," the show aims to focus on Beijing's rich historical experiences and modern progress in cultural and ­urban development to imagine how the city in the future can become an even more embracing international hub for bridging diverse cultures across the world.  Twenty artists, from both China and overseas, have co-organized the show to offer artworks such as architectural models and installations that show how the future or urbanism can be interpreted differently.Building of Background, a photographic series by Chinese creator Sun Haiting shows how Beijing's welfare housing developed from 1970 through to the 1990s. Architecture firm OPEN's 2nd Ring 2049 project also proposes greener solutions for upgrading Beijing's core urban area.  "While these architectural works are more like imaginative art proposals, they still make me feel how much I've missed out when observing the city I've been living in," Xu Sanni, a visitor to the show, told the Global Times on Saturday.  The show is curated by ­Chinese architect Ma Yansong, who told the Global Times that the show aims to merge how the world imagines future urban areas and also the city of Beijing.
