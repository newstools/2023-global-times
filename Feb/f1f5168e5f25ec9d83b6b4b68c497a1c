It also cited industry insider as saying that the competition of the concert market will be very fierce in 2023 and 2024.   According to an announcement by China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism in January, new commercial performance applications involving people from overseas were still suspended, except for those who are already in the Chinese mainland.China's tourism has been embarking on a rapid recovery, after Chinese authorities downgraded COVID response in December. According to an analysis by CAPA,9,400 commercial performances were held during the seven-day Spring Festival holidays which started on January 21, up 40.92 percent year-on-year. Revenues from ticket sales also expanded 3.85 percent to 378 million yuan ($54.99 million), rebounding to about 80 percent of the pre-epidemic level in 2019. During the 40-day Spring Festival travel rush, which lasted from January 7 to Wednesday, 4.73 billion passenger trips were made, a significant rebound compared with last year, according to data released by the Ministry of Transport on Thursday.Global Times
