Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin Photo: fmprc.gov.cnChina on Tuesday expressed serious concerns over joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the US, urging relevant parties to do more to contribute to peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula, instead of fueling the tension.The remarks were made by Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The spokesperson said that the crux of how the Korean Peninsula situation gets to where it is today is clear. The main reason is that the parties concerned have refused to respond to the denuclearization measures taken by North Korea, and continued to pressure and deter North Korea. Seoul and Washington launched their biggest joint military exercises in years starting Monday, and North Korea said it tested submarine-launched cruise missiles in apparent protest of the drills, media reported. The current situation on the Korean Peninsula is highly complex and sensitive. All parties concerned should remain restrained and do more things that are conducive to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, not otherwise, he added. On March 8, before the military drill, North Korean officials warned in a statement on Tuesday that it would be a "clear declaration of war" if its missiles were shot down over the Pacific Ocean.
