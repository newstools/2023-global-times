Ambassador Wim Geerts of the Netherlands to China participated in the Ambassador's Round Table: Cross-Cultural Communication and Global Economic and Trade Cooperation in the New Media Era, organized by the Center for China and Globalization. For both the economy and diplomacy, the COVID-19 has once again highlighted the importance of digital innovation. Despite restricted international mobility, people are able to continue to communicate, exchange ideas and trade continually to digital communication and ecommerce. "In an increasingly digital world where our dependence on digital services is growing, a well-balanced set of international rules for digital trade and e-commerce is crucial," Wim Geerts said. These rules can facilitate inclusive growth in global e-commerce, thus helping bridge the digital divide while ensuring a level playing field and addressing issues related to consumer protection and cybersecurity.
