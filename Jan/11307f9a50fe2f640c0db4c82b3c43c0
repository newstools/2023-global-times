While the peak in rural parts of the province arrived a little bit late than in the cities, and the number has also begun to decline.Chongqing health officials said the number of people receiving treatment at fever clinics from hospitals at all levels fell sharply after December 20, with the municipality passing its peak period between December 12 and December 23. Sichuan's daily infections are also declining with more than 80 percent of residents in Sichuan having been infected.The city of Foshan and Huizhou in Guangdong, as well as the city of Sanya and Haikou in Hainan, said the peak was in late December and they have bridged over their peak infection period.As the first infection peak has passed in many Chinese cities, experts said that the second wave of infection is estimated to reach its height between May and June in 2023.During the second infection peak, 25 to 50 percent of people may be infected but probably with milder symptoms as the virus' virulence becomes increasingly weaker, Zhang Wenhong, head of the infectious disease department at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, who is also director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases, was quoted as saying in media reports.
