Illustration: Liu Rui/Global TimesDuring the Spring Festival holidays, while others are busy enjoying food and visiting relatives and friends, singles are often pushed into meeting blind dates under pressure to get married. Some people find the idea of urging marriage repulsive, and as long as related topics are brought up, generational conflicts will arise. At the same time, although young people feel anxious, stressed, and even painful about urging marriages, the other side of the coin is that the pursuit of love and intimacy is still a deep desire for many people. In addition, after experiencing the epidemic, young people have started rethinking their view of marriage and love, while the attitude of some parents has also changed. These parents are more concerned with their children's health, happiness, and sense of independence, and they value individual ideas. It is more important for a person to have a sound personality and independent thinking than to be married or not. A 30-year-old woman shared this metaphor: "If the current life is a tree, love is one of the branches, and there are many other branches such as family, friendship, hobbies, and learning. The proportion of each branch is different. I want to work hard to keep the tree strong and balanced so that I don't get too upset when a branch is lost."
