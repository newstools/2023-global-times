Niazi said at the international fleet review on Tuesday that the Nanning is a wonderful ship.Some 50 countries participated in the AMAN-23, with Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the US also sending warships.It marks China's first major military diplomatic event since it entered a post-COVID era this year, observers said.The drills hosted by the Pakistan Navy served as a bridge that allowed countries to display their capabilities and conduct face-to-face meetings, which enabled them to enhance mutual understanding, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday.China's military development serves to safeguard world peace and regional stability, as it will continue to boost military exchanges and cooperation with more countries in the future, Song said.It can enhance military transparency between countries and help control and manage differences, Song said. "China is confident, and is willing to communicate," he said.China's next foreign military exchange event is expected to come soon, as South Africa will host a joint exercise with Russia and China on its east coast from Friday to February 27, Reuters reported in January.During AMAN-23, the participating US warship failed to make a port call in Karachi and only showed up during the sea phase, the Global Times learned.It shows that the US Navy was not confident and was not willing to communicate with China and others, Song said."The US often accuses China of being not transparent with its military, but in fact, it is the US that is not transparent," Song said.
