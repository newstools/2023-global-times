Yet the themes vary, ranging from childhood terror to changes in the relationship between humans and natures, and even reaching outer space.Modern commentary"This case is a meaningful and successful trial of the combination of traditional content producer and modern streaming platform. The series does an excellent job of presenting Chinese-style imagination and Eastern aesthetic spirit," Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University, told the Global Times on Saturday. "We still need to see if this type of storytelling can be accepted by overseas audiences, but the series should be internationally competitive as it illustrates the essence of Chinese culture very well." Based on the famous novel Journey to the West, the first 22-minute episode Nobody follows a low-ranking pig demon as he prepares to kill a monk and his disciples, the main characters from the book, on orders from the Wolf King and his bear supervisor.The pig demon is a close friend of a crow demon. The duo are often ignored and their dignity trampled on by their bosses. In the end, the crow loses his life after he creatively uses his own feathers to manufacture better-quality arrows, which the boss doesn't appreciate and regards as a challenge to his authority. Realizing that the monk represents greatness and justice while the demons stand on the opposite side, the pig demon decides to stand on the side of what is right. Chinese netizens gave Nobody overwhelming praise, saying the producers have injected new vitality into traditional Chinese classics through creativity and that they are eagerly waiting for the next episode of the series."I won't let my friends miss this excellent work; it's China's pride," a 33-year-old Shanghai white-collar worker told the Global Times."It is the mission of Chinese cultural enterprises to use good Chinese stories to more vividly and profoundly explain issues of common concern for mankind, and to focus on building appealing and influential ­Chinese cultural soft power," Li Zao, the chief producer of the series, told the Global Times.Many ­reviewers noted how the first episode acts like a commentary on modern life, saying the life of the pig is a portrayal of low-ranking office workers who are struggling to make ends meet but never give up pursuing what is good, true and beautiful in life.The second episode, the ­17-minute Goose Mountain, sparked a huge amount of discussion and speculation, as it tells a very fantastical story. Based on China's mythological collection, Xu Qi Xie Ji by Liang Wujun of the Southern Dynasties (420-589), the episode has been praised for its visual spectacle and expressive Chinese style, fully demonstrating the beauty of mysterious romance and Chinese aesthetics. The episode's director Hu Rui told media that the story is "not as complicated as everyone thinks" and that there are many "interesting, beautiful and thought-provoking" ancient fantasy novels that are still relevant for today's society.
