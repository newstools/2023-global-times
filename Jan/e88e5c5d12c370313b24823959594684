Wang added that for the field of digital collectibles, the launch of the platform indicated that the country has a national-level compliant secondary trading platform, which will unleash greater value in the trading of digital assets under government regulation.The establishment of the platform came after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly released 20 new measures to strengthen growth of digital economy and boost high-quality economic development.According to the document, the country will build basic data systems in four aspects: data property rights, circulation and transaction, revenue distribution and security governance.
