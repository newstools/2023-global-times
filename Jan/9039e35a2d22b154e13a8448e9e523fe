Those who test positive need to be treated in a timely manner.Moreover, all cities and provinces in China no longer implement the approval system for the crew of international voyage ships to change shifts at domestic ports, and only perform entry-exit inspection.Several major ports in China have followed suit as of Sunday, the Global Times learned.The moves have received support from industry insiders who are expecting a trade rebound soon.A person with a large international shipping company told the Global Times on Sunday that it is exhilarating news for shipping companies, since crew changes can be conducted as scheduled, which is more efficient and measurable."We are looking for specific details regarding the implementation of the measures in localities," she said.A manager with a local logistics company in East China's Jiangsu Province surnamed Zhao said that the lifting of the restrictions simplifies procedures, cuts costs and increases confidence among companies doing business in international trade."It will be conducive to the rapid flow of trade. For port companies, they can effectively reduce logistics costs while promoting efficient operation of the entire logistics channel and the growth of the foreign trade industry," Zhao Nan from the Shanghai International Shipping Research Center told the Global Times on Sunday.A full trade recovery is expected in the second half of the year, probably around October, the expert said.Global Times
