At the legal aspect, there is no precise definition of cyber violence, clear and feasible judicial interpretation, according to the proposal of Li Dongsheng, who is also founder and chairman of TCL, a Guangdong-based electronics company.When comes to cyber violence cases, there is no specific law in place, Li noted, highlighting the urgency to enact such law to better regulate those cases.Furthermore, Li suggested establishing an online recognition model using technology to better identify cyber violence cases and solve the problem of obtaining evidence relating to cyber violence.A blacklist mechanism can also be built to suspend accounts of individuals and organizations that violate rules, Li addedOver the years, tragedies caused by cyberbullying have been seen from time to time. A recent incident involving a young girl who committed suicide due to cyberbullying attracted a whirlwind of attention. Zheng Linghua, the 28-year-old with dyed pink hair, took her letter of admission for graduate school to surprise her 84-year-old grandfather, who was in the hospital at the time. To mark the moment, Zheng took a picture of her and her grandfather and posted it on social media.However, online attacks overwhelmed her with some spreading rumors about the "improper relationship between her and her grandfather" and others labeling her as a "deceitful goblin" because of her "unconventional" pink hair. Zheng had tried to record evidence of those who posted their violent online comments and sought to safeguard her own rights through legal means, but her complaints submitted to the online platform went nowhere and those behind the cyberbullying could not be found. After prolonged depression, the young girl eventually committed suicide.Global Times
