By exchanging views with Russia on the Ukraine crisis, China is taking a highly necessary step in trying to find common ground to solve the Ukraine crisis," Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.Cui said China's 12-point peace plan is not about shouting slogans, but about real action to solve the crisis."Qin elaborated on China's views and wished to get feedback from not only the Russian side, but from other parties in the international community. Through talks with all parties, we can find and enlarge the intersection to strengthen progress toward ceasing hostilities, which can at least end the current status of extreme opposition," Cui said.Qin said China is willing to work with the international community including Russia to maintain peace, security and prosperity in the face of the complex and serious international situation. Lavrov said Russia is willing to strengthen strategic communication with China to inject more stability into the international system.Lavrov stated that Russia supports and will actively participate in Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiatives, and will continue to strengthen coordination within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS.Qin also explained China's insistence on a political solution and peace talks to German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on the same day, urging certain countries to stop fanning the flames and to find a solution through a sustained European security framework.Baerbock said Germany valued China's 12 proposals for the crisis and hoped China could exert important influence in solving it.
