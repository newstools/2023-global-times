This is main purpose of medical visualization," Zhou told the Global Times.Medical visualization is used in multiple situations, such as in teaching materials for both experienced doctors and medical students, or presenting fun scientific knowledge that the general public can easily understand. Through their efforts, the human body is no longer 2D slices seen on CT scanners, but something much more lifelike.The imMed team recently made a name for themselves by entering Sina Weibo's trending list with a video of a life-like 3D beating heart.In the video, four white to almost transparent valves flap open and close with every heartbeat. Created by the team with the use of computer learning and 3D technology, this animated heart never tires.

It wasn't long before he met Ma."We both agreed at the time that although domestic medical visualization was still very basic, it was a huge potential market that one day could equal companies overseas that started over 120 years ago," Zhou explained.And their efforts have paid off, as many well-known scientists have chosen the team to draw illustrations for them."Among roughly 200 scientists who published their papers in global magazines or journals such as Nature every year, many of their illustrations were composed by our team," Ma said.Zhou said that their next goal is to transform their works into creative products and help establish a new subject of study at universities. Kuang Zheng, the team's 3D visual effects director, and Wu Fulin, a digital sculpting director, also contributed to this story.
