His delegation consisted of representatives from the three Belgian regions of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels and the commissioner for agriculture. Hoogmartens was received by the Mayor of Chongqing Hu Henghua. They discussed cooperation in the fields of logistics, agriculture and academia and explored areas for further cooperation such as life science and biotechnology. The ambassador also attended the premiere of a symphony composed by Belgian artist, composer, pianist and conductor Peter Ritzen at the Chongqing Guotai Art Center. The 10th anniversary of the friendship city relations between Antwerp and Chongqing can be considered the focal point of the ambassador's  trip. There are various collaborative projects which have taken place between the two cities in the last decade. Liu Hanlong, a deputy-president of Chongqing University, shared with the embassy's delegation the successful experience of the long-standing cooperation between the University of Antwerp and Chongqing University.
