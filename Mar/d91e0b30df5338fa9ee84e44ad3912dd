Hou Kai was appointed as auditor-general of the National Audit Office.The appointment came one day after Xi signed a presidential order appointing Li Qiang as China's premier. Guiding economic growth The appointments have inspired a great deal of confidence as well as high hope among market observers that the new cabinet lineup will steer China toward full-fledged economic recovery after the country walked out of a lengthy economic trough following the optimization of coronavirus management measures and as the COVID situation stabilizes. "The appointments reflect the central government's respect for professional knowledge, science and technology, and the law of economic development, meanwhile it also show that the Party and the government have given full consideration to the continuity and stability of policies when considering candidates," Wang Jun, an expert at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.Dong Shaopeng, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, also told the Global Times on Sunday that the appointment of those ministerial heads reflects the unity of political and professional requirements, as those ministers have been well tested and accumulated a lot of experience in their corresponding fields.It's worth noticing that several ministers have served as senior company executives in relative industries in the past. For instance, Jin Zhuanglong, head of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, was chairman of the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. Wang Zhigang, the Minister of Science and Technology (MST) alsos erved as general manger of the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation.According to Wang Jun, appointing officials with professional quality is a very important link to ensuring the prosperity of the country's cause. "Talents with scientific and technological backgrounds and professional experience can better understand and implement the Party's strategic deployment, which is also helpful to achieving China's goal of high-quality development," Wang said. Last week, China unveiled a sweeping reform plan for a slew of state institutions with a focus on restructuring the MST and establishing a national financial regulatory administration. With the transferring of functions such as technology policymaking for the agricultural sector to other ministries, the MST is tasked primarily with a bigger role - to improve a new system for mobilizing the nation to make technological breakthroughs. Kang Yi, head of China's National Bureau of Statistics, said on Sunday during an interview that he is confident of China's general economic improvement this year and the country's ability to achieve around 5 percent economic growth target based on his judgment on China's economic development fundamentals and observation of China's economic operation trend in the first two months this year. He also said that China will have wide development space and potential seen in the medium to long-term perspective, according to a report of the chinanews.com. Cao Heping, an expert from Peking University, also told the Global Times on Sunday that judging by China's economic data and implementation of new economic policies in the first quarter, this year's GDP growth goal is not difficult to achieve.Focus on financial stability According to the experts, the decision to keep Yi Gang on his post is also a reflection of the country's stress on financial stability at a time when financial fluctuations are intensifying on global markets. Yi Gang was appointed PBC governor in March 2018. "Firstly, it affirms the contributions and achievements made by these officials in their previous posts, which is a high recognition of their professionalism. At the same time, it also represents that China's basic policies remain unchanged, which emphasizes continuity and stability," said Wang Jun.Yi Gang repeatedly stressed the importance of keeping financial markets stable in public speeches. At a recent press conference, he said that the PBC aims to keep the yuan basically steady against the US dollar, leaving the market to drive small fluctuations in the exchange rate. China has set up a national financial regulatory administration as part of the aforementioned institutional reforms, reflecting the country's continued efforts to tackle financial risks. Directly under the State Council, the proposed administration will be in charge of regulating the financial industry except the securities sector.Experts also stressed that it's uttermost important to keep financial market stable when external market fluctuations are widening amid global economic slowdown, US interest rate hikes and geo-political tensions.
